## The `tibble` package

![](images/tibble-logo.png){width=10%}

The [`tibble` package](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) provides the central data structure `tibble` for the **storage of tabular (rectangular) data** within the `tidyverse` universe.

```{r data-example, echo=FALSE}

tribble(
~Year,~Make,~Model,
1997,"Ford","E350",
2000,"Mercury","Cougar"
)

```


A `tibble` is an extension of the basic `data.frame` data structure and thus:

- each column holds data of *one* data type (e.g. numbers like `<dbl>`, text `<chr>`, ...)
- different columns can represent different data types (see above)
- columns are typically *named* (bold in above table)
- all columns have the same lengths (2 in the example)
  - i.e. all 2nd elements of all columns form the 2nd row
  
Within the `tidyverse`, typically

- rows are called *observations* and
- columns are called *variables* (of an observation).


The following chapter of *R for Data Science* introduced `tibble`s in detail.

- [10. Tibbles](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html)

You can use the subsequent interactive consoles to revise the examples.

```{r tibble-1, exercise=TRUE}
tibble(
  x = 1:5, 
  y = 1, 
  z = x ^ 2 + y
)
```

Transposed initialization using `tribble()` function:

```{r tribble-1, exercise=TRUE}
tribble(
  ~x, ~y, ~z,
  #--|--|----
  "a", 2, 3.6,
  "b", 1, 8.5
)
```

Named column access (i.e. accessing list of values from *one* table column with the respective name), can be done via two ways:

- "dollar notation"
- "double-bracket notation"

```{r tibble-column, exercise=TRUE}
df <- tibble(
  x = 0:3,
  y = 2^x
)

glimpse(df)

# Extract by name
df$y       # "dollar notation"
df[["y"]]  # "double-bracket notation"

# Extract by position
df[[2]]    # not recommended
```

**Check**: Compare the output of `df[2]` with the one from above!
What can you infer/deduce from the result?

```{r tibble-column-solution}
# When using single-bracket notation "df[2]", we get a table (with one column) as a result 
# rather than a list of values!
```

### Exercises

How can you tell if an object is a tibble? Have you heard of [`is_tibble()`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/is_tibble.html) already or can imagine its use?

Also check the output of the `str()` function, which provides the "*structure*" of the data container (see its [help page](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.6.2/topics/str) for details).

```{r ex-1, exercise=TRUE}
# data set 1
mtcars
# data set 2
mpg

```

```{r ex-1-solution}
# checking whether they are tibble
is_tibble(mtcars)
is_tibble(mpg)
# checking the data structures
str(mtcars)
str(mpg)
```


Compare and contrast the following operations on a `data.frame` and equivalent `tibble`. 
What is different? 
Why might the default data frame behaviors cause you frustration?

```{r ex-2, exercise=TRUE}
df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
# name-based column access
df$x
# comma-based subsetting notation: [ rows , columns ] : empty = all
str( df[, "xyz"] )
str( df[, c("abc", "xyz")] )
```

```{r ex-2-solution}
# convert data.frame to tibble and repeat:
tbl <- as_tibble(df)

# In a data.frame, the $ operator will match any column name that starts with the name following it. 
# Since there is a column named "xyz", the expression "df$x" will be expanded to "df$xyz". 
# This behavior of the $ operator saves a few keystrokes, but it can result in accidentally using 
# a different column than you thought you were using.
tbl$x
# This is not supported for tibbles, to avoid unexpected behavior.

# With data.frames, with [ the type of object that is returned differs on the number of columns. 
# If it is one column, it won’t return a data.frame, but instead will return a vector. 
# With more than one column, then it will return a data.frame. 
# This is fine if you know what you are passing in, but suppose you did df[ , vars] where vars was a variable. 
# Then what that code does depends on length(vars) and you’d have to write code to account for those situations or risk bugs.
str(tbl[, "xyz"])
str(tbl[, c("abc", "xyz")])
# both calls return a tibble
```


If you have the name of a variable column stored in an object, e.g. `var <- "xyz"`, how can you extract the respective column from a tibble?

```{r ex-3, exercise=TRUE}
# my data
df <- tibble(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
# my columns of interested in a variable 
var <- "xyz"
# how to access the columns in "df" via "var"?

```

```{r ex-3-solution}
# name-based access not possible, because "df$var" would look for a column named "var". 
# requires double-bracket notation:
df[[var]]
```


Practice referring to non-syntactic names in the following data frame:

```{r ex-annoy}
annoying <- tibble( `1` = 1:5, `2` = `1` * 2 + rnorm(length(`1`)) )
print(annoying)
```

- Extracting the variable called `1`.

```{r ex-annoy-1, exercise=TRUE}
annoying <- tibble( `1` = 1:10, `2` = `1` * 2 + rnorm(length(`1`)) )
```

```{r ex-annoy-1-solution}
annoying[["1"]]
# or
annoying$`1`
```

- Plotting a scatterplot of `1` vs `2`.

```{r ex-annoy-2, exercise=TRUE}
annoying <- tibble( `1` = 1:10, `2` = `1` * 2 + rnorm(length(`1`)) )
```

```{r ex-annoy-2-solution}
ggplot(annoying, aes(x = `1`, y = `2`)) +
  geom_point()
```

- Creating a new column called `3` which is `2` divided by `1`.

```{r ex-annoy-3, exercise=TRUE}
annoying <- tibble( `1` = 1:10, `2` = `1` * 2 + rnorm(length(`1`)) )
# todo

# check result
glimpse(annoying)
```

```{r ex-annoy-3-solution}
# direct creation via naming 
annoying[["3"]] = annoying$`2` / annoying$`1`
# or
annoying[["3"]] <- annoying[["2"]] / annoying[["1"]]
# (re)creation + overwriting  # try to avoid! ;)
annoying <- tibble( `1` = annoying$`1`, 
                    `2` = annoying$`2`,
                    `3` = `2` / `1`)
# something you will learn later
mutate(annoying, `3` = `2` / `1`)
```

- Renaming the columns to `one` and `two`.

```{r ex-annoy-4, exercise=TRUE}
annoying <- tibble( `1` = 1:10, `2` = `1` * 2 + rnorm(length(`1`)) )
# todo

# check result
glimpse(annoying)
```

```{r ex-annoy-4-solution}
# (re)creation + overwriting  # try to avoid! ;)
annoying <- tibble( one = annoying$`1`, 
                    two = annoying$`2`)
# something you will learn later
annoying <- rename(annoying, one = `1`, two = `2`)
```





## Wrap-up

But before we continue, think about the following questions, which can be answered with the current material.


- How to create a `tibble` from scratch? 
- Do you remember both ways (via column specification and the transposed (row-like) form)?
- How to access table columns by name? Is there more than one way?
- What is produced when accessing a `tibble`'s column using single-bracket notation like `mtcars[2]`, i.e. using *subsetting*?
