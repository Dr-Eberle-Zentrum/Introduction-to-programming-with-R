## How to start?

Most of the major initial questions of programming novices are *Where do I start? How to begin? How to tackle the problem?*

Thus, before we start to get deeper into any programming or data processing, we first have to train our mind set for *algorithmic problem solving*. This is also known as *algorithmic* or *computational thinking*, which is briefly introduced in the following [video](https://youtu.be/_TWsmF8l418).

## General remarks

When given a task to be solved via programming, the following general remarks might be helpful!

- FIRST, make A PLAN! That is, you have to make written notes to identify individual MAJOR steps/parts. 
- Once you have the first plan: RESTART DECOMPOSITION, i.e. revise your steps whether they can be SPLIT INTO DETAILED steps.
