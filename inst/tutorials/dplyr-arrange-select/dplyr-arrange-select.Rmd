## The `dplyr` package

![](images/dplyr-logo.png){width=10%}

The [`dplyr` package](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) provides the central functions for data transformation within the `tidyverse` universe.
Common tasks of data transformation are typically made of a serious of steps that can be implemented by the following *verbs* of dplyr: 

- *filter*, 
- *mutate*, 
- *arrange*, 
- *select* and 
- *summarize*.

Within this tutorial, we focus on the **arrange** and **select** verbs and programming aspects related to them.


## Arrange

In the following, you will study the `arrange()` and `select()`-related parts of the [Data transformation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) chapter of the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) online tutorial of the book by Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund.

Since the online book tutorial is not interactive, you are encouraged to use the following interactive R consoles to

- repeat and follow the code examples of the tutorial
- solve the exercises of the tutorial (which we recreated below)

So let's start! 

In the following, we link (via the following section captions) the specific chapters and provide respective interactive consoles and additional information for each.


### [5.3 Arrange rows with `arrange()`](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#arrange-rows-with-arrange)

Note, both the `nycflights13` and `tidyverse` package are already loaded and ready within this tutorial.

```{r hadley-arrange-flights, exercise=TRUE}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
```


**Exercise:** Sort flights to find the most delayed flights. Find the flights that left earliest.

```{r hadley-arrange-delayed, exercise=TRUE}
arrange(flights, )
```

```{r hadley-arrange-delayed-solution}
# most delayed
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))
# left earliest (lowest negative department delay)
arrange(flights, dep_delay)
```


**Exercise:** Which flights travelled the farthest? Which travelled the shortest? (in terms of miles)

```{r hadley-arrange-farthest, exercise=TRUE}
arrange(flights, )
```

```{r hadley-arrange-farthest-solution}
# longest distance first
arrange(flights, desc(distance))
# shortest distance first
arrange(flights, distance)
```


**Exercise:** Sort flights to find the fastest (highest speed) flights.

```{r hadley-arrange-fastest, exercise=TRUE}
arrange(flights, )
```

```{r hadley-arrange-fastest-solution}
# interpreted as "shortest air time"
arrange(flights, air_time)
# interpreted as "ground speed" = distance/airtime
arrange(flights, desc( distance / air_time ))
```


**Exercise:** How could you use `arrange()` to sort all missing values of `dep_delay` to the start? (Hint: use `is.na()`).

```{r hadley-arrange-na-start, exercise=TRUE}
arrange(flights, )
```

```{r hadley-arrange-na-start-solution}
# since NA is pushed to the end, we have to "compute" a feature to put it first
# to this end, we can sort 'is.na()', which produces TRUE/FALSE values
# since TRUE is considered > than FALSE (== 0), we have to use descending order
arrange(flights, desc( is.na( dep_delay ) ) )
# if we want to keep the order of the remaining rows, we can use tie breaking
# i.e. we apply a second sorting directive independently for all TRUE and FALSE values from the first sorting
arrange(flights, desc( is.na( dep_delay ) ), desc(dep_delay) )
# now all NA are on top, followed by the descendingly sorted list of rows w.r.t dep_delay
```


**Exercise:** We know already that we can combine multiple functions via piping! Please check the following code and explain the different output!


```{r arrange-tie-break, exercise=TRUE}
myTable <- data.frame(
  A = c(2,2,1,1),
  B = c(3,4,3,4)
)
# sorting 1
arrange(myTable, A, B )
# sorting 2
arrange(myTable, A ) %>% arrange( B )
```

```{r arrange-tie-break-solution}
# sorting 1 uses column B only for tie-breaking, 
# i.e. for sorting groups of rows that have the same value in A
arrange(myTable, A, B )
# sorting 2 first sorts by A and than resorts by B
# i.e. no tie-breaking is done but the first sorting is somewhat maintained in the second
arrange(myTable, A ) %>% arrange( B )
```


## Select

### [5.4 Select columns with `select()`](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#select)


```{r hadley-select-flights, exercise=TRUE}
select(flights, year, month, day)
```



**Exercise:** Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select `dep_time`, `dep_delay`, `arr_time`, and `arr_delay` from `flights`.

```{r hadley-select-ways, exercise=TRUE}
select(flights, )
```

```{r hadley-select-ways-solution}
# unquoted list of names
select(flights, dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
# quoted names
select(flights, "dep_time", "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay")
# via numbers
select(flights, 4, 6, 7, 9) # !! don't do !! :D
# starts_with()
select(flights, starts_with("dep_"), starts_with("arr_"))
# ends_with() not working since it also matches other variable names!

# see full list at
# https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/transform.html#exercise-5.4.1
```


**Exercise:** What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a `select()` call?

```{r hadley-select-duplicates, exercise=TRUE}
select(flights, )
```

```{r hadley-select-duplicates-solution}
# duplicates are ignored
select(flights, year, month, year, year)
```


**Exercise:** What does the `any_of()` function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?

```{r ex-anyof, eval=FALSE}
```{r hadley-select-any-of, exercise=TRUE}
vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")

select(flights, )
```

```{r hadley-select-any-of-solution}
# allows to specify variable names that are NOT PRESENT in the data table
# without warning/error! (in contrast to 'all_of()')
select(flights, any_of(vars))
# see 
# https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/transform.html#exercise-5.4.3
```

**Exercise:** Does the result of running the following code surprise you?

```{r select-ignore-case, exercise=TRUE}
select(flights, contains("TIME"))
```

```{r select-ignore-case-solution}
# per default, 'contains' ignores case, ie. matches lower and upper case letters
# this can be disabled setting the 'ignore.case' argument to FALSE
select(flights, contains("TIME", ignore.case = FALSE))
```

How do the select helpers deal with case by default? How can you change that default? (Hint: check out their help page!)



## Wrap-up

But before we continue, think about the following questions, which can be answered with the current material.


```{r select-default-order, echo=FALSE}
question("The default order of `arrange()` is",
  answer(".. ascending", correct=TRUE),
  answer(".. descening"),
  answer(".. undefined (has to be chosen)")
)
```

```{r select-NA-handling, echo=FALSE}
question("`NA` values are",
  answer(".. ignored"),
  answer(".. pushed to the end", correct=TRUE),
  answer(".. removed"),
  answer(".. replaced by minimal values")
)
```


- What is done by `desc()` and why is there not `asc()` counterpart?
- What is tie-breaking and how to do?
- How to remove a specific column from the table?
- How to make a specific column the first? (i.e. keeping all columns)
