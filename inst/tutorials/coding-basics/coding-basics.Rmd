## `tibble` revisited

So far, we were mainly working with tables in the form of `tibble`s or `data.frame`s.
We learned already, that a `tibble` is eventually a special `data.frame` with a slightly changed behaviour.

In the following, we will revisit the data structure and compare it with others.

To this end, we will use the following tibble, which stores the amount of fruits in our fridge per week.

```{r fruit-per-week}
fruitsInFridge <- 
  tribble(
    ~week, ~tomato, ~apple,
       43L,       4,      2,
       44L,       2,      5,
       45L,       0,      1.5
  )
```

Note, the `L` after the `week` values tells R to treat the values integers (rather than arbitrary numbers that allow for fractions etc.).

When investigating the data *str*ucture using `str()`, we get the following.

```{r str-fruits}
str(fruitsInFridge)
```

Thus, we get a table with three columns of which one stores only `int`egers and the other two arbitrary `num`bers.

Technically, our table is an *ordered collection of* **columns**!
And **each column** is a **vector**, i.e. all data within a column is of the **same type**, and **all** columns have the **same length**. That's why we can create a tibble also by providing each column separately as a vector.

```{r fruit-per-week-col}
fruitsInFridge <- 
  tibble(
    week   = c(43L, 44L, 45L),
    tomato = c( 4,   2,   0),
    apple  = c( 2,   5,   1.5)
  )
```

## Subsetting

Before we continue, let's remember how we can access data within a tibble, which is called **subsetting**!
There are three ways to *subset* a data structure:

- `$name`
- `[[index]]` or `[[name]]`
- `[index (vector)]` or `[name (vector)]` or `[boolean vector]` (and negation)

### Let's try

Do you remember or guess which is for what? 
Test your knowledge by uncommenting one by one the following calls and guess the outcome before running it.
Remember: the `str()` command provides the *data structure* information of the provided object. 
Thus, you can use it to check whether the return value is a vector, tibble or whatever.

```{r subset-str, exercise=TRUE}
fruitsInFridge <- tibble(week=c(43L,44L,45L),tomato=c(4,2,0),apple=c(2,5,1.5))

# What data and data STRUCTURE is the outcome of the following calls?

# fruitsInFridge$tomato %>% str()
# fruitsInFridge[[2]] %>% str()
# fruitsInFridge[["tomato"]] %>% str()
# fruitsInFridge[2] %>% str()
# fruitsInFridge["tomato"] %>% str()
# fruitsInFridge[c(F,T,F)] %>% str()
# fruitsInFridge[-c(1,3)] %>% str()
```

```{r subset-str-solution}
# a vector (column)
fruitsInFridge$tomato %>% str()

# a vector (column)
fruitsInFridge[[2]] %>% str()
fruitsInFridge[["tomato"]] %>% str()

# a tibble with only one column
fruitsInFridge[2] %>% str()
fruitsInFridge["tomato"] %>% str()
fruitsInFridge[c(F,T,F)] %>% str()
fruitsInFridge[-c(1,3)] %>% str()
```


### Which for what

Given the last exercise you might have noted the following:

- `[]` provides you with the **same data structure** type as the original one, i.e. a **reduced form of the origin**, while
- `[[]]` provides a **single accessed element as its respective data structure**, and
- `$name` is eventually a short notation for `[["name"]]`.

This is depicted by the following images taken from [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/subsetting.html#subset-single) for the following list.
(We will go into details about lists in the next section.)

```{r listExampleAdvR, eval=FALSE}
x <- list(1:3, "a", 4:6)
```

Given, the list is depicted as train as follows, ie. the data structure via the locomotive and the content as cars.

![](images/train.png){width=60%}

Accessing a single element using `[]` or `[[]]` produces either a *train with one car* or just the *car content*.

![](images/train-single.png){width=60%}


Furthermore, `[[]]` *always* targets a *single element*, while `[]` allows to subset *multiple elements* (e.g. multiple columns of a data frame or elements from a vector) as shown below.

![](images/train-multiple.png){width=60%}

## `list` vs. `vector` and `tibble`

So far, we were working mainly on tabular data in the form of `tibble`s (or `data.frame`s).
The central idea (of tidy data) was that each row represents one data set (observation) while individual features (variables) are organized in columns.
Thus, all values in one column `vector` are of the same data type (integer, number, character, ...), while a row can show different data types.
This is exemplified in the following image.

![](images/tibble.png)
The way to define a tibble on the right of the image hints already at the underlying data organization: a tibble (or data.frame) is an ordered collection of column vectors (here visualized as dashed boxes), with the requirement that all columns have the same length!

Thus, we can access the first column both via its index `[[1]]` as well as its name `[["ASCII"]]`.


But what if we need to store data that is comprised of data of different type and that lacks the association of data elements, i.e. not all data elements are of the same size/length?
In that case we can neither use a `vector` (since it requires homogeneity of data type) nor a `tibble` (since it requires same column lengths).

Here, a `list` is what we need. 
A list is eventually "an ordered bag of something", i.e. you can store anything in it, even more bags.
Think about a list as a purse, which easily holds a comb, a pack of paper hankerchiefs and a wallet of money.
The comb is a (single element) vector as well as the pack of hankerchiefs while the wallet is most likely again a list since it has to hold coins, banknotes, cards, etc.
This is exemplified in the following.

```{r list-example, eval=FALSE}
myPurse <- list(
  comb <- TRUE,
  hankerchiefs <- c("used", "unused","crumpled"),
  wallet <- list(
    coins <- c(1,1,4,5,50),
    banknotes <- NA,
    cards <- c("DeutscheBank", "BC50")
  )
)
```

Note the similarity to the `tibble` from above, a `list` is also an ordered collection but it can contain anything.

Thus, one should know that a `data.frame` or `tibble` is eventually a special version of a `list` with additional features (like the condition about the equal column lengths etc.).

It is therefore not very surprising that you can access list elements the same way you do for `tibble`s, as you can try below.

```{r list-ex, exercise=TRUE}
# given the list from above
myPurse <- list(
  comb = TRUE,
  hankerchiefs = c("used", "unused","crumpled"),
  wallet = list(
    coins = c(1,1,4,5,50),
    banknotes = NA,
    cards = c("DeutscheBank", "BC50")
  )
)

# - access the pack of hankerchiefs
# - access the second card within the wallet
# - reduce the purse to comb and wallet

# can you do it via different subsetting methods?

```

```{r list-ex-solution}
# - access the pack of hankerchiefs

myPurse$hankerchiefs
myPurse[[2]]

# - access the second card within the wallet

myPurse$wallet$cards[[2]]
myPurse[["wallet"]][["cards"]][2]

# - reduce the purse to comb and wallet

myPurse[-3]
myPurse[1:2]

```

One can summarize the use of the data structures as follows:

- `vector` = just an array of things all of same data type
- `list` = bag of something, well suited for unstructured data
- `data.frame`/`tibble` = list of column vectors of same length (rows have meaning)


## `for` loop (iteration)

Next, we want to learn how to generalize programming tasks.
A first step is always to identify redundancy, that is code blocks that do mainly the same thing. If you find more than two related blocks you should start thinking about rewriting your code. We will exemplify this in the following.

To this end, we start with a data structure that provides us with the weights of all kind of things within our fridge, which we might need to know for subsequent cooking.

```{r fruitWeights}
fruitWeights <-
list(
  tomato = c(57, 43, 48, 27),
  apple = c(89, 93),
  pear = NA,
  nuts = list(    walnuts = c(3,8,9),    nutmeg = c(10) )
)
```

As a first task, we might want to know what is the heaviest fruit per category.
Since the data structure is no `data.frame` or `tibble`, we cannot use `summarize()` from the `dplyr` package or similar things. 
Thus, we write

```{r fruit-max}
print( str_c("Max. weight of tomato = " , 
             max( fruitWeights$tomato ) ) )
print( str_c("Max. weight of apple = " , 
             max( fruitWeights$apple ) ) )
# ...
```

A closer look reveals that we are doing always the same thing, only the name of the fruit is changed. A rewrite of the code shows this even better.

```{r fruit-max-rewrite, eval=FALSE}
print( str_c("Max. weight of ", 
             "tomato", 
             " = " , 
             max( fruitWeights[["tomato"]] ) ) )
print( str_c("Max. weight of ", 
             "apple",  
             " = " , 
             max( fruitWeights[["apple"]] ) ) )
```

Thus, we could rewrite using a variable instead:

```{r fruit-max-var, eval=FALSE}
# setting the name of the fruit of interest
fruitName <- "tomato"
print( str_c("Max. weight of ", 
             fruitName, # using the variable instead
             " = " , 
             max( fruitWeights[[fruitName]] ) ) ) # same here
# resetting the name of the fruit of interest
fruitName <- "apple"
print( str_c("Max. weight of ", 
             fruitName,  
             " = " , 
             max( fruitWeights[[fruitName]] ) ) )
```

Now the code redundancy of the `print()` statement is obvious.
If you have code blocks that are exactly the same and *only differ in the value of a variable*, that block is ready to be put into a `for` loop!

```{r fruit-max-for, eval=FALSE}
# defines a new variable and iterates over given values
for (fruitName in c("tomato","apple")) {
  print( str_c("Max. weight of ", 
             fruitName,  
             " = " , 
             max( fruitWeights[[fruitName]] ) ) )
}
```

That is, the `for` statement defines a new "running" variable (here `fruitName`) that "runs" over a given set of values, i.e. one after another the values are assigned to the variable and the subsequent code block (in `{}` brackets) is executed.

We can even get the values from another variable.

```{r fruit-max-for-var, exercise=TRUE}
# fruitnames of interest
fruitsOfInterest <- c("tomato","apple")
# defines a new variable and iterates over values from another variable
for (fruitName in fruitsOfInterest) {
  print( str_c("Max. weight of ", 
             fruitName,  
             " = " , 
             max( fruitWeights[[fruitName]] ) ) )
}

## What happens when you extend the list of fruitsOfInterest with "pear"?
## Can you explain your observation?
```

```{r fruit-max-for-var-solution}
# when running the code using
fruitsOfInterest <- c("tomato","apple","pear")
# the last (new) output is "NA", since no pear is in the fridge.
# Thus, str_c() is asked to concatenate strings with NA, which produces NA.
```


Eventually, the following happens (implicitly without needing us to write it down)...

```{r fruit-max-for-var-steps, eval=FALSE}
# fruitnames of interest
fruitsOfInterest <- c("tomato","apple")

# copy first value from value list
fruitName <- fruitsOfInterest[[1]]
# run code block
{ print( str_c("Max. weight of ", ... }
             
# copy second value from value list
fruitName <- fruitsOfInterest[[2]]
# run code block
{ print( str_c("Max. weight of ", ... }
```

.. which is more or less where we started from.
But the `for` loop provides a much smaller programming code.
Furthermore, it reduces the chance of coding errors due to copy-and-paste and provides a code that is much easier to maintain and read.

Note, you can provide any data object to a `for` loop as long you can access its elements via the `[[index]]` operator.

Given the latter statement, what do you think happens, when feeding a `tibble` to a `for` loop?

```{r for-tibble, exercise=TRUE}
# can you guess the outcome of this loop?
for (something in myPurse) {
  print( typeof( something ) )
}
```

```{r for-tibble-solution}
# since myPurse[[1]] provides the first COLUMN of the table,
# the for loop iterates all columns and provides the data type of its elements
# since "something" becomes column VECTORS in each loop iteration.
```

You will do iteration based on **`for` loops whenever you know (in advance) the (number of) elements** you want to iterate on, which is the most common iteration scenario.

In case the *number of iterations depends on* computations within the *code block of the loop*, a [`while` loop is needed](https://www.w3schools.com/r/r_while_loop.asp), which checks at the beginning of each iteration whether to do another round or to stop the iteration.
You can also manually stop iteration (in any loop) using the `break` statement, also [discussed here](https://www.w3schools.com/r/r_while_loop.asp).



### Try to avoid ...

For most data wrangling operations you **do not need a for loop** but can directly make use of the **vectorization** power of R, i.e. it typically directly operates on vectors without the need of explicit iteration.

For example, to identify the positions within a vector that are NA, you better use

```{r getNA-vec, class.source="bg-success"}
myVec <- c("a","b",NA,"d")
naPos <- seq_along(myVec)[ is.na(myVec) ]
print(naPos)
```

rather than


```{r getNA-for, class.source="bg-warning"}
naPos <- c()
for (i in seq_along(myVec) ) {
  if ( is.na( myVec[i] ) ) {
    naPos <- c( naPos, i )
  }
}
print(naPos)
```

So whenever you write a `for` loop, double check whether you can do without.
Using the vectorization power typically results in shorter and often faster code.


### Exercises

Let's assume we have good reasons to iterate the elements of a vector via its indices using a `for` loop.
In the example from above, we used `seq_along()` to identify the vector of indices for a given data structure.
In a first attempt, you might be tempted to write something like this instead:

```{r ex-seq-along, exercise=TRUE}
myVec <- c("a","b",NA,"d")
# explicit index set
for ( i in 1:4 ) { print( vec[i] ) }
# more generic using length()
for ( i in 1:length(vec) ) { print( vec[i] ) }
# fully generic
for ( i in seq_along(vec) ) { print( vec[i] ) }

# QUESTION: What are problems with the first two variants? Why use seq_along()?

```

```{r ex-seq-along-hint-1}
# explicit index set
for ( i in 1:4 ) { print( vec[i] ) }

# explicit setting of the upper bound (4) will cause issues as soon as we change
# the data structure, i.e. we face a longer or shorter vector
```

```{r ex-seq-along-hint-2}
# more generic using length()
for ( i in 1:length(vec) ) { print( vec[i] ) }

# using length() removes the problem of unknown vector lengths
# BUT: what about an empty vector? check the call using the following ..
vec <- c()
# in that case, length() will return 0 and the loop will iterate on the sequence c(1,0)
# Thus, it will try to access non-existing elements of vec...
```

```{r ex-seq-along-hint-3}
# more generic using length()
for ( i in seq_along(vec) ) { print( vec[i] ) }

# seq_along() generates the index vector to access the elements of a given object
# it can even deal with empty objects like this
vec <- c()
# where it will return also an empty vector of indices!
# Test it yourself!
```




## `if` statement (conditional)

Another common scenario in programming is the need for *conditional* code execution. 
That is you want to run some code block only in case some variable needs correction, the data type is no suited, the user input is missing, ... the list is never ending!

As an example, let's revisit our for loop from above using calling for an extended set of fruits.

```{r fruit-loop, exercise=TRUE}
# fruitnames of interest
fruitsOfInterest <- c("tomato","apple","pear")
# print max weights
for (fruitName in fruitsOfInterest) {
  print( str_c("Max. weight of ", 
             fruitName,  
             " = " , 
             max( fruitWeights[[fruitName]] ) ) )
}
```

Here we have a problem: the pears are empty (`NA`) and thus no output is generated.
Let's tackle this using the already known `is.na()` function to check whether fruit weights are available before printing.

```{r fruit-loop-NA, exercise=TRUE}
# fruitnames of interest
fruitsOfInterest <- c("tomato","apple","pear")
# print max weights
for (fruitName in fruitsOfInterest) {
  if( is.na(fruitWeights[[fruitName]]) ) {
    print( str_c("No ",fruitName," in the fridge"))
  } else {
    print( str_c("Max. weight of ", 
               fruitName,  
               " = " , 
               max( fruitWeights[[fruitName]] ) ) )
  }
}
```

When you study the code from above, you note that depending on the `NA` test, either the first or the second code block is executed and we get a nice output w.r.t. the missing pears.

When *running the code in the console*, you will face two warnings like the following.

```{r, class.source="bg-danger", eval=FALSE}
Warning messages:
1: In if (is.na(fruitWeights[[fruitName]])) { :
  the condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used
2: In if (is.na(fruitWeights[[fruitName]])) { :
  the condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used
```


When reading them carefully, you can learn an important point: `if` statements need **a single `TRUE/FALSE` value**!
When a vector or list with more than one element is provided to `is.na()`, each element is evaluated concerning `NA` and a respectively long data structure is returned:

```{r is.na-list,  class.output="bg-danger"}
is.na(fruitWeights[["tomato"]])
is.na(fruitWeights[["apple"]])
```

Since we have only two alternative code blocks within an `if-else`statement, a single value is needed to decide which way to go.
Thus, R takes only the first `TRUE/FALSE` element and ignores the rest (while throwing the observed warning).

This can be amended by extending our check:


```{r fruit-loop-NA2, exercise=TRUE}
# fruitnames of interest
fruitsOfInterest <- c("tomato","apple","pear")
# print max weights
for (fruitName in fruitsOfInterest) {
  if( length(fruitWeights[[fruitName]]) == 1 
      && is.na(fruitWeights[[fruitName]]) ) 
  {
    print( str_c("No ",fruitName," in the fridge"))
  } else {
    print( str_c("Max. weight of ", 
               fruitName,  
               " = " , 
               max( fruitWeights[[fruitName]] ) ) )
  }
}
```

Note, I used the logical `&&` (double ampersand!) operator to connect both statements in the sense of "AND", i.e. only if both are `TRUE` the overall statement is `TRUE`.
Alternatively, you can use `||` to combine them in an "OR" sense, i.e. if *at least* one of both is `TRUE` the OR combination is `TRUE` as well.
Both operators take *single logical values* and return a single value!

Finally, we want to take care of the "nut list problem".
Eventually, we could check whether the current fruit object is a `list` using the `is.list()` function.
Note, most "checking functions" in R start with `is...()` or `is_..()`!

```{r fruit-loop-NA-list, exercise=TRUE}
# fruitnames of interest
fruitsOfInterest <- c("tomato","apple","pear", "nuts")
# print max weights
for (fruitName in fruitsOfInterest) {
  if( length(fruitWeights[[fruitName]]) == 1 
      && is.na(fruitWeights[[fruitName]]) ) 
  {
    print( str_c("No ",fruitName," in the fridge"))
  } else if( is.list(fruitWeights[[fruitName]]) ) {
      print( str_c("Sorry, ", fruitName," is a list. Don't know how to handle!"))
    } else {
      print( str_c("Max. weight of ", 
                 fruitName,  
                 " = " , 
                 max( fruitWeights[[fruitName]] ) ) )
    }
}

## TASK: rewrite the code from above in way such that
# - no "fruitsOfInterest" variable is needed/used
# - the for loops runs on all (direct) elements of "fruitWeights" using the "names()" function

```

```{r fruit-loop-NA-list-solution}
# eventually, only the loop header has to be changed..
for (fruitName in names(fruitWeights)) {
  # ...
}
```

Note, we "chained" two conditional `if` statements after another to organize our three possible cases.

Note further, the `else {}` part of an `if` statement is optional and can be omitted if not needed.


### Exercises

Write an if-statement that tests whether there is at least one `NA` element within a given vector and prints a respective message in case.
Test the statement with the following two vectors.

```{r ex-if-na, exercise=TRUE}
# data for testing
dataWithoutNA <- 1:6
dataWithNA <- c(1,2,NA,4)
# TODO your check(s) to test for NA elements within a vector
```

```{r ex-if-na-hint-1}
# is.na() does an element-wise check and thus produces a vector of TRUE/FALSE
# rather than a single TRUE/FALSE as needed for an if-statement
is.na(dataWithNA)

# we need to somehow aggregate that information ...
```

```{r ex-if-na-hint-2}
# do you remember, what happens if you "sum up" TRUE/FALSE values?
sum( is.na(dataWithNA) )
# AHA! they are converted into 1/0 numbers via coercion!

# Given this single number, we are now able to formulate our test!
```

```{r ex-if-na-hint-3}
# full check for NA elements

# ie. we check if there is at least one NA element in the vector
if ( sum( is.na(dataWithNA) ) > 0 ) {
  print("vector contains an NA!")
}
# check the other vector
if ( sum( is.na(dataWithoutNA) ) > 0 ) {
  print("vector contains an NA!")
} else {
  print("all good...")
}

# NOTE: summing T/F values to aggregate information is a common trick for testing!

```


Generalize the problem from above by ...

```{r ex-for-if, exercise=TRUE}
# (i) joining both test vectors into one list and 

# (ii) write a for loop that does the NA testing on the list's elements.
```

```{r ex-for-if-hint-1}
# (i) joining both test vectors into one list and 
myData <- list(
  dataWithoutNA <- 1:6,
  dataWithNA <- c(1,2,NA,4)
  )
```

```{r ex-for-if-hint-2}
# (ii) write a for loop that does the NA testing on the list's elements.
for( vec in myData ) {
  if ( sum( is.na(vec) ) > 0 ) {
    print("vector contains an NA!")
  } else {
    print("all good...")
  }
}
```




## Writing your own `function`


When writing more and larger data analyses, one often sees another kind of code redundancy.
Namely more or less the **same code** for data wrangling is **copied in order to apply it to another data set**, i.e. typically *another variable*.

An example is given below when applying our printing strategy to both the `fruitWeights` as well as `fruitsInFridge` variable.

```{r code-repeat, exercise=TRUE}
# get max values of fruitWeights
for (fruitName in names(fruitWeights)) {
  if( length(fruitWeights[[fruitName]]) == 1 
      && is.na(fruitWeights[[fruitName]]) ) 
  {
    print( str_c("No ",fruitName," in the fridge"))
  } else if( is.list(fruitWeights[[fruitName]]) ) {
      print( str_c("Sorry, ", fruitName," is a list. Don't know how to handle!"))
    } else {
      print( str_c("Max. of ", 
                 fruitName,  
                 " = " , 
                 max( fruitWeights[[fruitName]] ) ) )
    }
}
# get max values of fruitsInFridge
for (fruitName in names(fruitsInFridge)) {
  if( length(fruitsInFridge[[fruitName]]) == 1 
      && is.na(fruitsInFridge[[fruitName]]) ) 
  {
    print( str_c("No ",fruitName," in the fridge"))
  } else if( is.list(fruitsInFridge[[fruitName]]) ) {
      print( str_c("Sorry, ", fruitName," is a list. Don't know how to handle!"))
    } else {
      print( str_c("Max. of ", 
                 fruitName,  
                 " = " , 
                 max( fruitsInFridge[[fruitName]] ) ) )
    }
}
```

When looking closely, the only *difference is the use of the two variables* in within the two parts.
Beside that, both parts are identical.

Whenever you observe such a situation it is time to generalize your code by defining a function!
A function comes with the following general layout.

```{r function-layout, class.source="bg-success", eval=FALSE}
nameOfMyFunction <- function( inputArgument1, inputArgument2, ... ) {
  # some code block to be executed that uses the arguments
}
```

In our case, the whole `for` loop defines the function body, i.e. the code block to be executed, while we replace the specific variables it is operating on (`fruitWeights` and `fruitsInFridge`) with a generic input argument name (`listOfInterest`) defined in the `function()` part.

```{r for-function, exercise=TRUE}

## CHECK THE TASK AT THE END OF THE CODE, PLEASE SCROLL DOWN !

# my first function that abstracts from the variable the loop is operating on
# there is only one input argument "listOfInterest" that provides the data to operate on
maxOfElements <- function( listOfInterest ) {
  # here comes the old code block but this time using "listOfInterest" instead
  # also the running variable is renamed to be more generic
  for (elementName in names(listOfInterest)) {
    if( length(listOfInterest[[elementName]]) == 1 
        && is.na(listOfInterest[[elementName]]) ) 
    {
      print( str_c("No ",elementName," in the fridge"))
    } else if( is.list(listOfInterest[[elementName]]) ) {
        print( str_c("Sorry, ", elementName," is a list. Don't know how to handle!"))
      } else {
        print( str_c("Max. of ", 
                   elementName,  
                   " = " , 
                   max( listOfInterest[[elementName]] ) ) )
      }
  }
}
# so far nothing happened
# the function is only DEFINED but you now need to explicitely call it!

maxOfElements(fruitWeights)

## TASK: now call it for fruitsInFridge!
```

```{r for-function-solution}
maxOfElements(fruitsInFridge)
```

Note, you always have to "execute" the code of a function, in order to "load it into R".
Afterwards, the function is ready to be used and shows in the "Environment" tab of RStudio in the "Functions" section.
This is exactly what happens when you "load" a library like `dplyr` or `ggplot2`, i.e. the function from the respective package are loaded for subsequent use.

### `return()` value

Instead of printing, we might want to store the data and provide it as a data structure for subsequent processing.
This can be done using the `return()` function. When it is called, it returns the given **single** object and stops the execution of the function code. Thus, subsequent code is *not executed!*


```{r for-function-return}
# my first function with return value
maxOfElements <- function( listOfInterest ) {
  # let's define an empty list to be filled
  returnList = list()
  # collect the data
  for (elementName in names(listOfInterest)) {
    if( (length(listOfInterest[[elementName]]) == 1 
          && is.na(listOfInterest[[elementName]]) ) 
        # Note, this combines the first two "if" checks with an OR statement!
        || is.list(listOfInterest[[elementName]]) ) 
    {
      # no information available, so dont provide any!
      returnList[[elementName]] = NA
    } else {
      # store maximum
      returnList[[elementName]] = max( listOfInterest[[elementName]] ) 
    }
  }
  # return the final list
  return( returnList )
}
# let's try (implicit print of the returned list)
maxOfElements(fruitWeights)
```




### Recursion

Given that we now have a function at hand, we can even generalize it to tackle the problem with the enclosed `nuts` list of the `fruitWeights` list.
In detail, whenever we encounter a list, we call again our `maxOfElements()` function (from within the function itself). This is called *recursion* or *recursive iteration*.

```{r for-function-recursive}
# recursive version that calls itself for sublists
maxOfElements <- function( listOfInterest ) {
 returnList = list()
 for (elementName in names(listOfInterest)) {
  if( length(listOfInterest[[elementName]]) == 1 
      && is.na(listOfInterest[[elementName]]) ) 
  {
    returnList[[elementName]] = NA
  } else if( is.list(listOfInterest[[elementName]]) ) {
    
    # let's call the same function on the sublist (recursive call)
    returnList[[elementName]] = maxOfElements( listOfInterest[[elementName]] )
    
  } else {
    # store maximum
    returnList[[elementName]] = max( listOfInterest[[elementName]] ) 
  }
 }
 return( returnList )
}
# let's test the recursive processing the nested data structure
maxOfElements(fruitWeights)
```


### Functions as input arguments

Finally, we might want to create a similar function to `maxOfElemens()` but this time returning the `min()` of each.
Again, as a first attempt, we would copy the code of `maxOfElement()`, rename it and replace the `max()` calls with `min()` calls. 
Even thinking about it, you might imagine the extent of code redundancy, which again is inefficient and a common cause for mistakes and trouble.

Instead, we can generalize our function to work with arbitrary functions.
To this end, we introduce another input argument, which takes the **name of the function to call**, i.e. the function name *without brackets*.
As done when generalizing from the variable we were working on, we now replace the function to call with the respective generic argument name.


```{r for-function-function, exercise=TRUE}

## CHECK THE TASK AT THE END OF THE CODE!

# generic version that calls a given function for property computation
propertyOfElements <- function( listOfInterest, propertyFunction = max ) {
 returnList = list()
 for (elementName in names(listOfInterest)) {
  if( length(listOfInterest[[elementName]]) == 1 
      && is.na(listOfInterest[[elementName]]) ) 
  {
    returnList[[elementName]] = NA
  } else if( is.list(listOfInterest[[elementName]]) ) {
    
    # we have to "forward" the "propertyFunction" value to the recursive call (explained below)
    returnList[[elementName]] = propertyOfElements( listOfInterest[[elementName]], propertyFunction )
  } else {
    
    # store the requested "property"
    returnList[[elementName]] = propertyFunction( listOfInterest[[elementName]] ) 
  }
 }
 return( returnList )
}
# let's call with different functions (without argument names relying on argument order)
propertyOfElements(fruitWeights, max)
# or using explicit argument names for assignment
propertyOfElements( listOfInterest = fruitWeights, propertyFunction = min)

# TASK-1: identify the length of each element using a respective call to our new function

# TASK-2: call the function WITHOUT the second argument
# What do you observe? Any explanations?

```

```{r for-function-function-hint-1}

# TASK-1: calling using "length()" function
propertyOfElements(fruitWeights, length)

```

```{r for-function-function-hint-2}

# TASK-2: when calling the function without the second argument
propertyOfElements(fruitWeights)

# the default value "max" is used for "propertyFunction", 
# which is defined in the head of the function definition
```

Thus, we can store a "handle" to a function by assigning its "name" (without brackets) to a variable (or function argument, which is eventually a local variable).
That way, we can use the variable itself to subsequently call the function (see above).

When providing a value for an argument within the function definition (here done for the `propertyFunction` argument), the value can be omitted when calling the function. In that case, the provided default value is used for the argument.

Note, if we would have not included/forwarded the `propertyFunction` argument to the recursive call in the above function, the default value (`max`) would have been used for all recursively processed sublists, regardless what the user set to `propertyFunction` in the initial call!


### Exercises

Write a small function `simpelSum()` that takes two numbers and returns their sum.

```{r ex-sum, exercise=TRUE}
# my first summation function

# TODO

# let's test it by uncommenting and running the following
# simpleSum( 3, 2 )
```

```{r ex-sum-hint-1}
# my first summation function
# general layout is like this

simpleSum <- function( a, b ) {
  # TODO
}

```

```{r ex-sum-hint-2}
# my first summation function
simpleSum <- function( a, b ) {
  return( a + b )
}

```

What happens if you copy your/the solution from the last exercise down here and run your function with vectors rather than single numbers?


```{r ex-sum-vec, exercise=TRUE}
# TODO copy or rewrite simpleSum function here

# run and interpret what happened
simpleSum( 1:4, 3 )
simpleSum( 1:3, c(8,7,9) )
```

```{r ex-sum-vec-solution}
# When defining a function, you are only naming the arguments 
# but do not say what data type/structure they are.
# Thus, you can pass any kind of object as argument.
# If the operations you do within the function body are also working for
# vectors or lists (like it is the case for the "+" operator), the function
# will automatically work also for vector input.

# If this is not intended, you have to check the argument's data type, length,
# or structure with respective checks and throw warnings/errors if not suited.
simpleSum <- function( a, b ) {
  # input checks
  stopifnot( is.numeric(a), is.numeric(b) )
  stopifnot( length(a) == 1, length(b) == 1 )
  # final computation
  return( a + b )
}

```




## Wrap-up

But before we continue, think about the following questions, which can be answered with the current material.

- What are the main differences between `list`, `tibble` and `vector`?
- What's the difference when using `[]` or `[[]]` for subsetting?
- When do you need a `for` loop and when would you use a `while` loop?
- What is the final value of `TRUE && FALSE` and of `TRUE || FALSE`?
- Do you know how to write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum?
- What happens when you assign a function name (without brackets) to a variable?
