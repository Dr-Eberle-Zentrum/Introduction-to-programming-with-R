- important data structures
  - `vector` = all elements are same data type
  - `list` = most general, can contain anything, any size, ...
  - `data.frame/tibble` = list of vectors (of same lengths) 
    - ==> if tidy, resp. column values (in one row) are associated with one observation
- *subsetting* can be done using
  - `[]` = reduces the current object to the selected part(s) (same data container)
  - `[[]]` = provides a *single element* (element-specific data container)
  - `$` = shortcut for `[[]]` with name
- programming of workflows often requires
  - *iteration* of code blocks (`for` or `while` loops)
  - *conditional* code execution (`if/else` statements)
  - *generalization* of code blocks (`function` definition and usage)
- redundant code w.r.t. **values** of a variable ==> `for` loop generalization
- redundant code w.r.t. **variables** or **function** calls ==> `function` generalization
- iteration tricks
  - use `seq_along()` to generate the list of *valid indices* of a vector or list
  - use `names()` to access the vector of *element names* of an object
  - *best iterate directly on the elements*, if you don't need the element names or index!
- functions can provide a *single* return object via calling `return()` 
  - multiple return values have to aggregated into a single list or vector before returning them
- when a function calls itself it is called a *recursive call* or *recursion*
- a function name (without brackets) can be stored in and used from variables/arguments to call the function
