## The `tidyr` package

![](images/tidyr-logo.png){width=10%}

Raw data imported from data acquisition is often structured in a way that is either 
defined by the way the data was generated or by constraints to minimize storage etc.
Typically, this does not render the data as *tidy* w.r.t. the `tidyverse` philosophy, i.e.

- rows encode a single observation,
- variables define columns of the table, and
- each cell holds only a single value.

In order to use `ggplot2` or to do use `dplyr` for efficient data processing, we need to first reformat the data into a "tidy" format.

This process is supported by the [`tidyr` package](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/).

The main data wrangling aspects from the package covered by this tutorial are:

- Converting wide to long (more tidy) table format (called *pivoting*)
- Filling missing values
- Decomposing values into multiple cells (or vice versa)

The more advanced functions about *nested data* (lists or tables in tables etc.) are not covered in the following.

## Tidy data

To learn the basics to tidy up your data, we will follow the respective R4DS section.

- [12 Tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)
  - 12.1 Introduction
  - 12.2 Tidy data

Within this interactive tutorial, we have preloaded the `table1` to `table4b` data sets from the book for direct usage within the interactive consoles.
Just run the following to see the respective content of each table.

```{r tabledata, exercise=TRUE}
# predefined data sets from the book chapter
table1
table2
table3
table4a
table4b
```

### 12.2.1 Exercises 

Check the following link for [a discussion of Exercise 1 (pros and cons)](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/tidy-data.html#exercise-12.2.1).

Exercise 2 is not central to the tutorial and relatively complicated to solve.
If you want to tackle it anyway, you can look up a [solution for Exercise 2 here](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/tidy-data.html#exercise-12.2.2).

I recommend to try Exercise 3, i.e. recreating the plot showing change in cases over time using `table2` instead of `table1`. What do you need to do first?

![](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/tidy_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=60%}

```{r ex3, exercise=TRUE}
table2
```


```{r ex3-hint-1}
# First plot the table to see what variables are to be mapped to what aesthetics.
```


```{r ex3-hint-2}
# Next you might need to prune unneeded data from the table to 
# start plotting.
```

```{r ex3-hint-3}
# Finally, some polishing of the plot might be needed to ensure it looks the same.
```

```{r ex3-solution}
table2 %>%
  filter(type == "cases") %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, count)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = country), colour = "grey50") +
  geom_point(aes(colour = country)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(table2$year)) +
  ylab("cases")

# alternatively to scale_x_... you can make "year" a categorical variable
table2 %>%
  filter(type == "cases") %>%
  ggplot(aes(as.factor(year), count)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = country), colour = "grey50") +
  geom_point(aes(colour = country)) +
  labs(x="year", y="cases")
```





### [12.3 Pivoting](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#pivoting) (click to open the section)

This section introduces how to convert from wide to long table format (depicted below) and vice versa.

[![](images/original-dfs-tidy.png){width=40%}](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/main/images/tidyr-pivoting.gif)


The linked [animated image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/main/images/tidyr-pivoting.gif) exemplifies the transition (both from [here](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain)).



You can use the following interactive consoles to follow and alter the examples.

```{r pivot, exercise=TRUE}
table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = "year", values_to = "cases")
```


#### 12.3.3 Exercises

(1) Why are pivot_longer() and pivot_wider() not perfectly symmetrical?
Carefully consider the following example:

```{r pivot-ex1, exercise=TRUE}
stocks <- tibble(
  year   = c(2015, 2015, 2016, 2016),
  half  = c(   1,    2,     1,    2),
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.92, 0.17)
)
stocks %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = return) %>% 
  pivot_longer(`2015`:`2016`, names_to = "year", values_to = "return")
```

(Hint: look at the variable types and think about column names.)

Check out the [detailed solution discussion](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/tidy-data.html#exercise-12.3.1)

(2) Why does this code fail?

```{r pivot-ex2, exercise=TRUE}
table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(1999, 2000), names_to = "year", values_to = "cases")
```

```{r pivot-ex2-solution}
# 1999 and 2000 are no well formatted variable names.
# thus they have to be quoted!
table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = "year", values_to = "cases")
# or
table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(c("1999", "2000"), names_to = "year", values_to = "cases")
```

(3) You might look up [discussion of Exercise 3]().

(4) Tidy the simple tibble below. Do you need to make it wider or longer? What are the variables?

```{r pivot-ex4, exercise=TRUE}
preg <- tribble(
  ~pregnant, ~male, ~female,
  "yes", NA, 10,
  "no", 20, 12
)
```

```{r pivot-ex4-solution}
# We need to make it longer!

# the following contains NA values... not super nice!
pivot_longer(preg, c(male, female), names_to = "sex", values_to = "count")
```

Further cleanup of the `preg` data is discussed [here](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/tidy-data.html#exercise-12.3.4).



### [12.4 Separating and uniting](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#separating-and-uniting)

Next we want to know how to split values into columns and how to join multiple column values into one.

```{r separate, exercise=TRUE}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"))
```


#### 12.4.3 Exercises

(1) What do the `extra` and `fill` arguments do in `separate()`? Experiment with the various options for the following two toy datasets.

```{r sep-ex1, exercise=TRUE}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))

tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))
```

Compare your observations with [this discussion of Exercise 1](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/tidy-data.html#exercise-12.4.1).



(2) Both `unite()` and `separate()` have a `remove` argument. What does it do? Why would you set it to `FALSE`?

```{r sep-ex3, exercise=TRUE}
# no code to do here, just check the solution if interested!
``` 

```{r sep-ex3-solution}
# The remove argument discards input columns in the result data frame. 
# You would set it to FALSE if you want to create a new variable, but keep the old one.
```

(3) Question three is beyond our scope, but a solution can be found [here](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/tidy-data.html#exercise-12.4.3)




### [12.5 Missing values](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#missing-values-3)

Finally, we need to deal with missing values that can pop up when pivoting tables or that are missing right from the start within the raw data.
Sometime, such values can be inferred from other (e.g. previous) values within the table or we want to discard them.
The `tidyr` package provide specific functions for such use cases.

```{r na-stocks, example=TRUE}
# preloaded data set for inspection
stocks
# first example produces NA values via pivoting
stocks %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = return)
```


```{r na-treatment, example=TRUE}
# preloaded data set
treatment %>% 
  fill(person)
```

Beside the functions discussed within the R4DS section, you should also know the following:

- `drop_na()` removes all rows that contain `NA` values (in the specified columns).
- `replace_na()` provides replaces `NA` with the given value

Check the effect of the following `mutate` call and try both functions with the `stocks` data on the result.

```{r na-drop, exercise=TRUE}
stocksNA <- mutate(stocks, qtr = ifelse(qtr==3, NA, qtr))
```

```{r na-drop, exercise=TRUE}
# 

# removing the problematic row
stocksNA %>% 
  drop_na()
# or explicitly using a variable name
stocksNA %>% 
  drop_na(return)

# replacing the values for each column
stocksNA %>% 
  replace_na(list(qtr=3,return=12))
# or just for one
stocksNA %>% 
  replace_na(list(qtr=3))

```



#### 12.5.1 Exercises

(1) Compare and contrast the `fill` arguments to `pivot_wider()` and `complete()`.

Solution is discussed [here](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/tidy-data.html#exercise-12.5.1).

(2) What does the `direction` argument to `fill()` do?


```{r na-ex2, exercise=TRUE}
# no code to do here, just check the solution if interested!
``` 

```{r na-ex2-solution}
# With "fill()", the "direction" determines whether NA values should be replaced 
# by the previous non-missing value ("down") or the next non-missing value ("up").
```



## Wrap-up

But before we continue, think about the following questions, which can be answered with the current material.

- What are "features" of "untidy" data?
- Why can't you use such data for plotting with `ggplot2`?
- Can you distinguish long and wide table format?
- What are possible ways to deal with missing values?
- Can you imagine a use case (not discussed so far) where you would need the `separate()` function?


```{r child = 'images/cheatsheet.Rmd'}
