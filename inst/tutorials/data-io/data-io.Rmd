## The `readr` package

![](images/readr-logo.png){width=10%}

The [`readr` package](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) provides the central functions for the **import of tabular (rectangular) data** within the `tidyverse` universe.

Data that is read by this package is typically organized in rows where the *first line* provides the columns names and *columns are separated by* a specific single *character* or of fixed *width*.
An example of a comma-separated (value) [CSV] file is given below.

```
Year,Make,Model
1997,Ford,E350
2000,Mercury,Cougar
```

Things are getting complicated due to two things:

- representation of floating point numbers (delimiter differs depending on country codes, e.g. `.` = en or `,` = de)
- encoding of text data (potentially including the column separator letter)

### Decimal separator and `locale`

Thus, beside specifying the column delimiter, one also has to take care about the decimal separator in floating point numbers.
In Germany, one typically has to deal with the German notation using `,` as a decimal separator and `.` to structure the data in magnitudes (thousands), e.g. `3.004.300,5` = "three million four thousand three hundred and a half".
The respective English notation (more common and typically used notation in programming language) is `3,004,300.5` and uses the opposite notation.

These reverse notations often cause havoc in data import/export! Be wary!

The setting of the separators is based on the so called `locale`, which specifies the country's data encoding specifics.
As a default, R uses the USA locale. You can switch to a different encoding using

```{r local-specification}
locale()
```

Each of the given variables within the locale can be set via arguments.
Given this, you can alter the reading behavior by setting the `locale` argument of the called `readr` function.

```{r readr-local, exercise=TRUE}
# reading data directly from character string without changing the locale
read_delim( "A B C\n1,3 42 4.300", delim = " " )
# testing our (incomplete) German locale definition
locale(date_names="de", decimal_mark=",", grouping_mark=".")
# reading where "\n" encodes the line break
read_delim( "A B C\n1,3 42 4.300", delim = " ", locale=locale(decimal_mark=",", grouping_mark=".") )
```

### Text encoding

Another source for headache is when you text contains letters not used in the standard English letter code like mutated vowels, i.e. umlauts `ü` in German language.
While numbers (typically) use a fixed amount of data space (i.e. number of bits for encoding), letters are typically encoded using a variable number of data space.
(In short: all possible letters and symbols are indexed and higher index numbers need more space. See [UTF8 encoding at wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) for more details.)

Thus, to "decode" (i.e. read) text data from a file, one has to tell what letter encoding was used to create the file.

Per default, **`readr` uses** the international and powerful **[UTF8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoding**, making is capable of reading any letter.
So let's try:

```{r readr-encoding, exercise=TRUE}
# reading data with the umlaut "ü"
read_csv( "A,B\nWürze,42")
```

Often output looks weird, i.e. we get `\xfc` instead of `ü` (depending on the language settings of your machine and your operating system like Microsoft Windows).
Looking up the [`\xfc` encoding](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+00FC), we find out all is well, it is an `ü` encoding, but we are still not satisfied.

*What happened?*

If you see this "backslash"-notation, you input wasn't UTF8 encoded.. 
Most likely, your computer used the (older) [Latin-1 encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1), which takes more space due to fixed-size encoding.
Thus, we have to tell `readr` to use this instead, by changing the `locale` with the argument `encoding="latin1"`.
Try to change the above call respectively!

```{r readr-encoding-solution}
# reading data with the umlaut "ü"
# but using latin1 letter encoding for reading
read_csv( "A,B\nWürze,42", locale=locale( encoding = "latin1"))
```


### Quoting of text

When importing textual data that also (potentially) contains the value/column separating symbol (e.g. the `,`), the text data has to be quoted within the file, e.g.

```
Year,Make,Model,Customer
1997,Ford,E350,"Gates, Bill"
2000,Mercury,Cougar,"Monroe, Marilyn"
```

Since **any quoting symbol** can be used like `'`, `"` or even `|` or `*`, one might have to specify the respective letter when reading data (while `readr` typically does a good job in guessing it). 

```{r readr-quote, exercise=TRUE}
# reading data with the specific quoting letter '
read_csv( "A,B,C\n'yes,no',42,'4.300'", quote = "'")
```

Note, **R still tries to guess the correct data type** and to convert the values from a column into that. 
Here, it made the third column a number value.
When this is not intended and you want to define the data type of a specific column, you can provide it using a named list specifying the types.
For instance try `col_types = list( C="c" )` as an additional argument in the reading call from above.

```{r readr-quote-solution}
# reading data with the specific quoting letter '
# ensuring the third column "C" stays a character variable
read_csv( "A,B,C\n'yes,no',42,'4.300'", quote = "'", col_types = list( C="c" ))
```

If interested in further details, you might want to check the `?read_csv` help page or the `vignette("readr")`.


### `NA` values

Finally, the placeholder used in the data to specify missing (*not available* `NA`) data might be different from the standard string notation `NA`.
You can provide a list of respective strings via the `na` argument of the `readr` reading functions.

For instance, per default `readr` assumes empty values and `NA` to be missing, i.e. the argument is set to `na = c("", "NA")`.
Change the call from below such that both `k.A.` as well as `-` are treated as missing values.

```{r readr-na, exercise=TRUE}
# reading data with missing values
read_csv( "A,B,C\n3,k.A.,-")
```

```{r readr-na-solution}
# reading data with missing values
read_csv( "A,B,C\n3,k.A.,-", na = c("k.A.", "-"))
```


### Common formats

Common file formats and respective separators are for flat rectangular data are:

- CSV: comma (or semicolon) separated values
  - `read_csv()` = using `,` (and typically assuming english decimal point notation)
  - `read_csv2()` = using `;` (and the German `,`-based decimal point definition)
- TSV: tabular separated values
  - `read_tsv()`
- FWF: fixed width file (columns are always taking a specific number of letters)
  - `read_fwf()` = requires the number of letters for each column to use

All delimiter-using functions can be substituted using the more generic function

- `read_delim( delim="X" )` = general reading using the given delimiter (here `X`)

To check the full set of arguments e.g. to guide how many lines are to be skipped, to define a commenting prefix to ignore lines, etc., please check the respective help pages.

Given your gained knowledge so far, try to provide a `read_delim()` call that produces exactly the same output as the `read_csv2()` call from below.


```{r readr-csv2, exercise=TRUE}
# reading data using read_csv2()
read_csv2( "A;B;C\n3,2;'och noe';4.000")

# TODO: try to get the same using read_delim()
```

```{r readr-csv2-solution}
# reading data using read_csv2()
read_csv2( "A;B;C\n3,2;'och noe';4.000")

# reading data using read_delim()
read_delim( "A;B;C\n3,2;'och noe';4.000", 
           delim=";", 
           locale=locale(decimal_mark = ",",grouping_mark = "."))
```

*Note:* there are *similar functions from the basic R* system for the same purpose, i.e. `read.csv()`, `read.csv2()`, `read.delim()` and `read.fwf()`.

These functions:

- have a different set of arguments (e.g. locale stuff are direct arguments)
- return a `data.frame` and not a `tibble` and thus 
  - have a different default behavior w.r.t. text reading and factorization
- might be a little bit slower for larger files

It is thus recommended to use the `readr` functions (with underscore `_`), but the base R functions will typically do the same job.


### Exercises

Before we run some exercises, browse the first parts of the "Data import" chapter or R4DS.

- 11 [Data Import](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html#data-import)
  - 11.1 Introduction
  - 11.2 Getting started

**When reaching the exercises STOP** and answer the following questions


```{r q-ready-to-continue, echo=FALSE}
question("What function would you use to read a file where fields were separated with '|'?",
  answer("read_delim()", correct=T),
  answer("read_csv()"),
  answer("read_fwf()"),
  answer("read_psv()")
)
```


Sometimes strings in a CSV file contain commas. 
To prevent them from causing problems they need to be surrounded by a quoting character, like `"` or `'`. 
By convention, `read_csv()` assumes that the quoting character will be `"`, and if you want to change it you’ll need to use `read_delim()` instead. 
What arguments do you need to specify to read the following text into a data frame?

```{r readr-textvar, exercise=TRUE}
# read the following text
x <- "x,y\n1,'a,b'"
```

```{r readr-textvar-solution}
read_delim(x, ",", quote = "'")
```

The full list of answers to all exercises from the data import chapter can be found [here](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/data-import.html#getting-started).

*If* you have *lots of time or are interested* in the details how `readr` parses the data, you should look up the next two sections of the "Data import" chapter, i.e.

- optional [11.3 Parsing a vector](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html#parsing-a-vector)
- optional [11.4 Parsing a file](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html#parsing-a-file)


### Multiple files

If you are facing multiple files that share a common table structure and column naming, 
e.g. measurements from different runs, summaries for different groups, etc., 
you can load all files in one go using wildcards (`*`) within the name.


## Data sources

You can read data from different sources:

- from *file* on *your computer* (using the name and maybe the path)
  - e.g. `read_csv("my_super_file.csv")`
- from *the internet* using its URL
  - e.g. `read_csv("http://be.clever.com/online_super_file.csv")`
- from *text* (variables) (text needs to be multi-line, i.e. with line breaks encoded by `\n`)
  - e.g. `read_csv( "A,B,C\n3,4,5" )` directly from string encoding
  - or `myText<-"A,B,C\n3,4,5"; read_csv(myText)` from a variable that holds the text

Note, the file can even be a compressed file with ending

- `.gz` = GNU ZIP
- `.bz2` = bzip2
- `.xz` = LZMA-based xz

that can be read without prior decompression, e.g.

`read_csv("my_compressed_super_file.csv.gz")`



## Working directory

A common error message when working with data import looks like the output of the following call.

```{r no-file, exercise=TRUE}
read_csv("my_important_data.csv")
```

That is: **R doesn't find the file you want to work with!**

There are two workarounds:

(I) Give the *absolute path* to the file on *YOUR COMPUTER*, e.g. using

```{r no-file-abs, eval=FALSE}
read_csv("C:/secret_folder/project/x/my_important_data.csv")
```

This has a limitation: *IT ONLY WORKS ON YOUR COMPUTER!* 

So when possible **DON'T DO**! ;)

Better:

(II) Set the working directory!

The what? All operations you run in R are done with respect to a current working directory, i.e. some place somewhere in your computer. You can check where you are currently working using the following:

```{r check-cwd, exercise=TRUE}
# check current working directory
getwd()
```

To change it, you have multiple options:

- use the RStudio menu "Session >> Set Working Directory >> ..."
  - select a folder via the "Choose Directory" dialog
  - set "To Source File Location" e.g. if the file to read is *in the same folder*
- use the "Files" View tab of RStudio
  - browse to the folder of interest
  - in the "More" menu, you find "Set as Working Directory"
- use the `setwd()` command (which is eventually invoked by the methods from above)

For instance:

```{r setwd-example, eval=FALSE}
# change to working directory (e.g. once at the beginning of your script file)
setwd("C:/secret_folder/project/x")
# now read the file without path specification (from the current updated working directory)
read_csv("my_important_data.csv")
```

You might say: *Hey, this still only works on my computer!* 

Ok, that's true, but now I can get it running by changing/ignoring **ONE LINE OF CODE** instead of changing all file reading/writing operations in your whole script! :)

Thus, the whole script is much more portable than before!


*Note:* in Linux or Apple systems, directories are separated via backslash `\`. 
Since this typically marks the notation of a special character in character strings (like "\n" to encode a line break), one has to escape them in path notations. For instance:

```{r setwd-example-linux, eval=FALSE}
# change to working directory in a UNIX-based system
setwd("\\mnt\\c\\secret_folder\\project\\x")
```



## Writing data

Of course you can also write data back to file, for instance using

```{r write-csv, eval=FALSE}
write_csv(myData, "my_super_file.csv")
```

*Note again*: if no path is specified along with the file name, *the file will be placed in your current working directory*!

There are respective `write_` functions for each of the `read_` functions discussed so far, as well as two additional ones to deal with Microsoft Excel specifics w.r.t. CSV files.

Please check the short section on file writing from the R4DS book:

- [11.5 Writing to a file](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html#writing-to-a-file)


## Excel & Co

Often data comes in the format designed for Excel or is stored within an online Google Sheet.
For both, respective import/export functions are available, which are provided in dedicated packages.

### The `readxl` package

![](images/readxl-logo.png){width=10%}

The [`readxl` package](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/) provides simple functions for the **import of Microsoft Excel files** within the `tidyverse` universe.
Note, the package is currently not automatically loaded with `tidyverse` package but needs explicit loading.

- `read_xls()` reads `.xls` files (old MS Excel format)
- `read_xlsx()` reads the newer `.xlsx` format
- `read_excel()` guesses the file type

you can first check the available sheets within the file using

- `excel_sheets()` provides the sheet names of the file

The following example shows how to use the functions.

```{r readxl-example, exercise=TRUE}
library(readxl)
# load an example data file
xlsx_example <- readxl_example("datasets.xlsx")
# show location of the file
print(xlsx_example)
# check sheets
excel_sheets(xlsx_example)
# read a specific part of the file
read_xlsx( xlsx_example,
           sheet = "chickwts",
           n_max = 5)
```

Change the example w.r.t. the following questions:

- What happens if you omit the sheet argument from the call?
- What if you specify the number `3` instead of a sheet's name?

```{r readxl-example-solution}
# if no sheet is specified, the FIRST SHEET only is read
read_xlsx( xlsx_example, n_max = 5)
# sheets can also be specified via their index (w.r.t. the oder provided in excel_sheets())
read_xlsx( xlsx_example, sheet=3, n_max = 5)
```

You can also just read a specific subset/range of cells, which is useful when 
accessing complicated/messy MS Excel sheets. 
To this end use the 

- `range` argument to specify a subset of cells to read

Check out the [`readxl` package website](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/) for examples.


### The `writexl` package

![](images/writexl-logo.png){width=10%}

The [`writexl` package](https://docs.ropensci.org/writexl/) is an additional package (needs installation) to enable the **writing/export of Microsoft Excel files**.

- `write_xlsx()` writes data in MS Excel format

```{r writexl-example, exercise=TRUE}
library(writexl)
# let's write a single sheet to file using the example data set "chickwts"
# NOTE: when no target file is specified, a temporary file is created (and it's name returned)
tmpFileName <- write_xlsx( chickwts )
# check the name
print(tmpFileName)
# let's read it back
library(readxl)
excel_sheets(tmpFileName)
read_xlsx(tmpFileName, n_max = 3)
# removing the temporary file (not really needed but good practice)
unlink(tmpFileName)
```

You can write *multiple and/or named sheets* when providing a *list of data frames* as input.

This is exemplified in the following.

```{r writexl-example-multisheet, exercise=TRUE}
library(writexl)
# let's write two sheets to file using the example data set "chickwts" for both
tmpFileName <- write_xlsx( list( data1 = chickwts, duplicatedData = chickwts ) )
# let's read it back
library(readxl)
excel_sheets(tmpFileName)
read_xlsx(tmpFileName, n_max = 3)
# removing the temporary file (not really needed but good practice)
unlink(tmpFileName)
```

There are minor formatting options using the arguments

- `col_names` = whether or not the columns names should be written to file
- `format_headers` = if `TRUE` column names are centered and bold


### The `googlesheets4` package

![](images/googlesheets4-logo.png){width=10%}

The [`googlesheets4` package](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/) is a `tidyverse` package to enable the **import/export of online Google Sheets**.

The package's functions need an enabled login to your Google account (or will open the respective Google login page when needed).
Subsequently, you can read/write from/to online sheets using

- `read_sheet()`
- `gs4_create()` creates a new (empty) sheet
- `sheet_write()` (over)writes a sheet

All in all the usage is similar to the functions discussed already.
So if interested in details please refer to the [googlesheets4 package website](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/).


## Wrap-up

But before we continue, think about the following questions, which can be answered with the current material.


- How to read a tabular-separated table file?
- How to deal with language specific number and text encoding?
- What can I do if the data type of a column is not correctly guessed by `readr`?
- Can I directly read a file from the internet?
- What is defined by the working directory?
- What are ways to alter the working directory and to check to what it is currently set?
