## The `dplyr` package

![](images/dplyr-logo.png){width=10%}

The [`dplyr` package](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) provides the central functions for data transformation within the `tidyverse` universe.
Common tasks of data transformation are typically made of a serious of steps that can be implemented by the following *verbs* of dplyr: 

- *filter*, 
- *mutate*, 
- *arrange*, 
- *select* and 
- *summarize*.

Within this tutorial, we focus on the **summarize** verb, which is typically used together with **grouping**, and programming aspects related to it


## Summarize + grouping

In the following, you will study the `grouped summary`-related parts of the [Data transformation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) chapter of the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) online tutorial of the book by Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund.

Since the online book tutorial is not interactive, you are encouraged to use the following interactive R consoles to

- repeat and follow the code examples of the tutorial
- solve the exercises of the tutorial (which we recreated below)

So let's start! 

In the following, we link (via the following section captions) the specific chapters and provide respective interactive consoles and additional information for each.


### [5.6 Grouped summaries with `summarise()`](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#grouped-summaries-with-summarise)

Note, both the `nycflights13` and `tidyverse` package are already loaded and ready within this tutorial.

Thus, you can directly start redoing the examples! 


```{r hadley-summarize, exercise=TRUE}
summarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Note, both writings `summarise()` and `summarize()` are correct and working. Use w.r.t. your British or U.S. English style.


### [5.6.1 Combining multiple operations with the pipe](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#combining-multiple-operations-with-the-pipe)

That's a recap of piping, but worth looking at!

**Exercise:** Test what happens when removing `na.rm = TRUE` from the code below and rewrite it, such that it is using a pipe and no temporary variable `by_day`.

```{r hadley-group-summarize, exercise=TRUE}
by_day <- group_by(flights, month)
summarise(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r hadley-group-summarize-solution}
group_by(flights, day) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(dep_delay))
# the data contains unknown 'NA' values, such that the mean cannot be computed.
# thus, the result of 'mean()' is unknown 'NA' too.
```


### [5.6.2 Missing values](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#missing-values-1)

Unknown `NA` values are common in real world data.
Since R takes it serious to be precise in its results, it will say "I don't know" (`NA`) as soon as it finds an `NA` within a data set it is asked to compute statistics on.

In order to deal with that, you have to explicitly encourage R to **ignore `NA` values** when you want it that way, using the `na.rm=TRUE` argument of functions like `mean()`, `sd()`, ...


**Exercise:** What month shows on average the higher departure delays, February or July? Write a pipe to be able to answer the question. Best by producing an output table with two rows that directly shows the result.

```{r pipe-delay-per-month, exercise=TRUE}
flights %>%
```

```{r pipe-delay-per-month-hint-1}
# best start with reducing the observations to February and July
```

```{r pipe-delay-per-month-hint-2}
# best start with reducing the observations to February and July
flights %>%
  filter( month %in% c(2,7)) %>%
```

```{r pipe-delay-per-month-hint-3}
# did you think about grouping yet?
```

```{r pipe-delay-per-month-hint-4}
flights %>%
  # first we best filter for the months of interest, i.e. 2 and 7
  filter( month %in% c(2,7)) %>%
  # next we group by month to do independent statistics
  group_by(month) %>%
```

```{r pipe-delay-per-month-hint-5}
# the summarizing statistics per group need to deal with NA values!
```

```{r pipe-delay-per-month-solution}
flights %>%
  # first we best filter for the months of interest, i.e. 2 and 7
  filter( month %in% c(2,7)) %>%
  # next we group by month to do independent statistics
  group_by(month) %>%
  # finally we compute the mean departure delay for each
  # remember, we have to ignore NA values!
  summarize( meanDepDelay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  # and it might be a good idea to sort it (descendingly, to put the answer on top)
  arrange(desc(meanDepDelay))
```


### [5.6.3 Counts](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#counts)

This section goes much into detail about statistics and how to interprete, which is beyond the focus of this course.

So please **study only up to second scatter plot** and the RStudio tip!

That is, skip the part about the baseball statistics!


**Exercise:** What month has the highest rate of canceled flights (`(is.na(arr_delay) | is.na(dep_delay))`)?

```{r pipe-cancel-rate, exercise=TRUE}
flights %>%
```

```{r pipe-cancel-rate-hint-1}
# first we have to find out for each flight whether it is canceled or not
```

```{r pipe-cancel-rate-hint-2}
# store if a flight is canceled
flights %>%
  mutate( cancelled = (is.na(arr_delay) | is.na(dep_delay))) %>%
```

```{r pipe-cancel-rate-hint-3}
# next we need a grouping and a summary for our question
```

```{r pipe-cancel-rate-hint-4}
flights %>%
  # store if a flight is canceled
  mutate( cancelled = (is.na(arr_delay) | is.na(dep_delay))) %>%
  # next we group by month to do independent statistics
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(  ) %>%
  # dont't forget sorting at the end!
```

```{r pipe-cancel-rate-solution}
flights %>%
  # store if a flight is canceled
  mutate( cancelled = (is.na(arr_delay) | is.na(dep_delay))) %>%
  # next we group by month to do independent statistics
  group_by(month) %>%
  # finally we compute the rate via counting the canceled and division by overall count
  summarize( cancellationRate = sum(cancelled) / n()) %>%
  # and it might be a good idea to sort it (descendingly, to put the answer on top)
  arrange(desc(cancellationRate))
```


### [5.6.4 Useful summary functions](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#summarise-funs)

The provided list of 'aggregation functions' is not complete, but gives a good overview on functions commonly used and needed.


**Exercise:** Come up with another approach that will give you the same output as `not_cancelled %>% count(dest)` and `not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance)` (without using `count()`).

```{r hadlay-no-count, exercise=TRUE}
# create subset
not_cancelled <- filter(flights, !is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))
# challenge 1
not_cancelled %>% count(dest)
# challenge 2
not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance)
```

```{r hadlay-no-count-solution}
# challenge 1
not_cancelled %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize( n=n() ) # just count number of observations
# challenge 2
not_cancelled %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarize( n=sum(distance) ) # sum distances of each group's observations
# alternatives using 'tally()' are discussed here
# https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/transform.html#exercise-5.6.2
```


**Exercise:** How many planes (identified by `tailnum`) flew more than 249,010 miles, i.e. ten times around the world?

```{r hadlay-plane-far, exercise=TRUE}
flights %>%
```

```{r hadlay-plane-far-hint-1}
# first compute cummulative distance per plane
```

```{r hadlay-plane-far-hint-2}
flights %>%
  # compute cummulative distance per plane
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarize( cumDist = sum(distance)) %>%
```


```{r hadlay-plane-far-hint-3}
# filter
```


```{r hadlay-plane-far-solution}
flights %>%
  # compute cummulative distance per plane
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarize( cumDist = sum(distance)) %>%
  # filter for long-running ones
  filter( cumDist > 249010)
```




### [5.6.5 Grouping by multiple variables](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#grouping-by-multiple-variables)

When grouping your data into "subtables" for subsequent independent operations, you will need to merge them back into a "normal" single table at some point.

This is done either implicitly by `summarize()` (but only one layer per call, see tutorial for details) or explicitly via `ungroup()` (all remaining grouping layers at once).


```{r hadlay-ungroup, exercise=TRUE}
daily <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
# check summary of groups
daily %>% summarise(flights = n())
# check effect of ungroup()
daily %>% 
  ungroup() %>%             # no longer grouped by date
  summarise(flights = n())  # all flights
```


### [5.7 Grouped mutates (and filters)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#grouped-mutates-and-filters)

Grouping the observations is often also useful to 

- filter groups, e.g. for some group-specific statistical property
- compute group-specifically additional variables
- find specific subgroups (top, tail, ..) of groups
- ...

**Exercise:** Compute for each destination the number of carriers that fly to it and filter for destinations operated by at least 2 carriers.


```{r hadlay-min-carriers, exercise=TRUE}
flights %>%
```

```{r hadlay-min-carriers-solution}
flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize( numCarriers = n_distinct(carrier)) %>%
  filter( numCarriers > 5)
```



**Exercise:** What is the destination targeted most often by planes (identified by `tailnum`) that flew more than 249,010 miles, i.e. ten times around the world?

```{r hadlay-plane-dest, exercise=TRUE}
flights %>%
```

```{r hadlay-plane-dest-hint-1}
# filter for planes that do not fulfill the distance criterion
```

```{r hadlay-plane-dest-hint-2}
flights %>%
  # compute distance per plane
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  mutate( cumDist = sum(distance)) %>%
```

```{r hadlay-plane-dest-hint-3}
# compute destination counts
```

```{r hadlay-plane-dest-hint-4}
flights %>%
  # filter planes below threshold
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  filter( sum(distance) > 249010) %>%
  # compute flights (of remaining planes) per destination
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(numFlightsOfFarPlanes = n()) %>%
```

```{r hadlay-plane-dest-hint-5}
# sort
```

```{r hadlay-plane-dest-solution}
flights %>%
  # filter planes below threshold
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  filter( sum(distance) > 249010) %>%
  # compute flights (of remaining planes) per destination
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(numFlightsOfFarPlanes = n()) %>%
  # sort descendingly
  arrange( desc(numFlightsOfFarPlanes) )
  
```


## In short in ModernDive

To recapitulate what you learned so far, you can **browse** the respective chapters from the ModernDive tutorial, specifically

- [3.3 `summarize` variables](https://moderndive.com/3-wrangling.html#summarize)
- [3.4 `group_by` rows](https://moderndive.com/3-wrangling.html#groupby)

Both provide a nice *graphical depiction* of both verbs as well as a *compact overview* with some *other examples*.


## Wrap-up

But before we continue, think about the following questions, which can be answered with the current material.


```{r q-recycling, echo=FALSE}
question("Aggregation function like `min()` can be used in",
  answer(".. `arrange()`"),
  answer(".. `filter()`", correct=TRUE),
  answer(".. `group_by()`"),
  answer(".. `mutate()`", correct=TRUE),
  answer(".. `select()`"),
  answer(".. `summarize()`", correct=TRUE)
)
```

- What is computed by `summarize( myTable, n=n() )`?
- What happens when multiple `group_by()` calls are used?
- What's the problem with `NA` values?
