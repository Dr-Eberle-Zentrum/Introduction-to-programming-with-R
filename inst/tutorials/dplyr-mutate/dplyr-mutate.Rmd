## The `dplyr` package

![](images/dplyr-logo.png){width=10%}

The [`dplyr` package](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) provides the central functions for data transformation within the `tidyverse` universe.
Common tasks of data transformation are typically made of a serious of steps that can be implemented by the following *verbs* of dplyr: 

- *filter*, 
- *mutate*, 
- *arrange*, 
- *select* and 
- *summarize*.

Within this tutorial, we focus on the **mutate** verb and programming aspects related to it


## Mutate

In the following, you will study the `mutate`-related parts of the [Data transformation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) chapter of the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) online tutorial of the book by Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund.

Since the online book tutorial is not interactive, you are encouraged to use the following interactive R consoles to

- repeat and follow the code examples of the tutorial
- solve the exercises of the tutorial (which we recreated below)

So let's start! 

In the following, we link (via the following section headlines) the specific chapters to be studied.
For each chapter, you find within each tutorial section respective interactive consoles and additional information.


### [5.5 Add new variables with `mutate()`](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#add-new-variables-with-mutate)

Note, both the `nycflights13` and `tidyverse` package are already loaded and ready within this tutorial. Also the `flights_sml` sub-dataset is precomputed and available.

```{r hadley-flights-sml}
flights_sml <- select(flights, 
  year:day, 
  ends_with("delay"), 
  distance, 
  air_time
)
print(flights_sml)
```

Thus, you can directly start redoing the examples!

```{r hadley-mutate-flights-sml, exercise=TRUE}
mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
  speed = distance / air_time * 60
)
# or 
mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)
```



**Exercise:** Currently `air_time` is convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because it does not really contain continuous numbers. 
Convert them to a more convenient representation of number of minutes since midnight.

```{r hadlay-mutate-rescale, exercise=TRUE}
mutate(flights_sml, )
```

```{r hadlay-mutate-rescale-solution}
# we need to decompose the 'HHMM' time format into 'HH' hours and 'MM' minutes to compute the overall minutes
# 'HH' can be extracted using modulo 100, i.e. 'air_time %/% 100'
# 'MM' can be extracted using rest division, i.e. 'air_time %% 100'
# since midnight is represented by '2400', it would be converted to 1440 minutes (24*60)
# -> thus, we have to do a final rest division by 1440 to handle the special case
# all in one go we want: (HH*60 + MM) %% 1440
mutate(flights_sml, 
  air_time_mins = (((air_time %/% 100) * 60) + (air_time %% 100)) %% 1440
)
# details are discussed here
# https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/transform.html#exercise-5.5.1
```


**Exercise:** Consider the following little data table. 

```{r hadlay-mutate-rank, exercise=TRUE}
rankme <- tibble(
  x = c(10, 5, 1, 5, 5)
)
# rank it!
mutate(rankme, )
```

```{r hadlay-mutate-rank-solution}
mutate(rankme,
  x_row_number = row_number(x), # consecutive numbers, no tie handling
  x_min_rank = min_rank(x), # ties have same rank but 'consume' resp. number of ranks (gaps)
  x_dense_rank = dense_rank(x) # ties have same rank but rank numbering is continuous
)
# further details in 
# https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/transform.html#exercise-5.5.4
```

Rank the `rankme` table from above w.r.t. `x` using the ranking functions `min_rank()`, `row_number()` and `dense_rank()`. How do they handle ties? Carefully read their documentation.


**Exercise:** What does `1:3 + 1:10` return? Why?

```{r hadlay-mutate-recycle, exercise=TRUE}
1:3 + 1:10
```

```{r hadlay-mutate-recycle-solution}
# produces a warning, since first vector is of length 3 and second of length 10, 
# which is no multiple of 3,
# which violates the recycling rule
1:3 + 1:10
```



## Wrap-up

But before we continue, think about the following questions, which can be answered with the current material.


```{r q-recycling, echo=FALSE}
question("The 'recycling rule' allows to",
  answer(".. combine vectors of different lengths", correct=TRUE),
  answer(".. restore deleted values"),
  answer(".. reuse a variable multiple times")
)
```

- Can we create a new variable based on multiple others?
- On what type of data can we do (i) arithmetic operations and (ii) logical comparison?
- How do we create a new column that features the single value `1` in each row?
- Keep `lag()` and `lead()` in mind, they will be powerful helpers one day!
- What is the difference between `mutate()` and `transmute()`?
