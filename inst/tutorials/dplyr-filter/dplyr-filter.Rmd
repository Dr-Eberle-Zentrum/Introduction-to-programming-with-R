## The `dplyr` package

![](images/dplyr-logo.png){width=10%}

The [`dplyr` package](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) provides the central functions for data transformation within the `tidyverse` universe.
Common tasks of data transformation are typically made of a serious of steps that can be implemented by the following *verbs* of dplyr: 

- *filter*, 
- *mutate*, 
- *arrange*, 
- *select* and 
- *summarize*.

Within this tutorial, we focus on the **filter** verb and programming aspects related to it.


## filter @R4DS

In the following, you will study the first parts of the [Data transformation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) chapter of the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) online tutorial of the book by Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund.

Since the online book tutorial is not interactive, you are encouraged to use the following interactive R consoles to

- repeat and follow the code examples of the tutorial
- solve the exercises of the tutorial (which we recreated below)

So let's start! 

In the following, we link (via the following section headlines) the specific chapters to be studied.
For each chapter, you find within each tutorial section respective interactive consoles and additional information.

### [5.1 Introduction](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#introduction-2)

Note, both the `nycflights13` and `tidyverse` package are already loaded and ready within this tutorial.

```{r hadley-transform-flights, exercise=TRUE}
head(flights)
```


### [5.2 Filter rows with `filter()`](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#filter-rows-with-filter)

For replaying the example, you can use the following console.

```{r hadley-filter-flights, exercise=TRUE}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```


**5.2.1 Comparisons**

First run the following code and investigate the result.

Afterwards, correct the code, such that all flights with `month` equal to 1 are selected.


```{r hadley-filter-flights-bug, exercise=TRUE}
filter(flights, month = 1)
```

```{r hadley-filter-flights-bug-solution}
filter(flights, month == 1)
# i.e. we need to use the comparison operator "==" rather than the assignment operator "="
```


Test the floating point precision issue yourself:

```{r hadley-float-point-problem, exercise=TRUE}
sqrt(2) ^ 2 == 2
1 / 49 * 49 == 1
```


**Exercise:** Find all flights that had an arrival delay `arr_delay` of two or more hours.

```{r hadley-filter-flights-delay, exercise=TRUE}
filter(flights, )
```

```{r hadley-filter-flights-delay-solution}
filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120)
# since the variable is in "minutes" we have to check for 120 minutes or above
```


### [5.2.2 Logical operators](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#logical-operators)

Alter the following selection such that November and December are excluded.

Also try the `%in%` operator. The latter requires the `c()` function, which **concatenates** values into a **vector** (similar to a column in a data table).

```{r hadley-filter-flights-or, exercise=TRUE}
filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)
```

```{r hadley-filter-flights-or-solution}
# you can either NEGATE (with "!") the selection of Nov or Dec
filter(flights, !(month == 11 | month == 12) )
# or list all months of interest in a specific vector
filter(flights, month %in% c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10) )
# or use negation with '%in%'
filter(flights, !(month %in% c(11,12) ) )
```

*NOTE*: Negation often requires brackets to be precise what to negate!


Try the following and explain the outcome

```{r hadley-filter-flights-and, exercise=TRUE}
filter(flights, day == 1 & day == 2)
```

```{r hadley-filter-flights-and-solution}
# the call selects ROWS where the day variable shows BOTH values 1 AND 2, which is not possible.

# thus, no row fulfills the criteria...
```


**Exercise:** Find all flights that flew to Houston (IAH or HOU).

```{r hadley-filter-flights-houston, exercise=TRUE}
filter(flights, )
```

```{r hadley-filter-flights-houston-hint}
# 'dest' is a character string variable, i.e. the values have to be quoted for checking
# like "IAH" or "HOU"
```

```{r hadley-filter-flights-houston-solution}
filter(flights, dest == "IAH" | dest == "HOU")
# or
filter(flights, dest %in% c("IAH","HOU") )
```


**Exercise:** Find all flights that departed in summer (July, August, and September).

```{r hadley-filter-flights-summer, exercise=TRUE}
filter(flights, )
```

```{r hadley-filter-flights-summer-hint}
# 'month' is a numerical variable encoding with values from 1-12
```

```{r hadley-filter-flights-summer-solution}
# since it is numeric, we can check boundaries
filter(flights, month >= 7, month <= 9)
# or explicit values
filter(flights, month == 7 | month == 8 | month == 9)
# or vector of values
filter(flights, month %in% c(7,8,9) )
```


Another useful dplyr filtering helper is `between()`. **What does it do?** (Check its [help page](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8/topics/between)!)

**Exercise:** Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the last challenge?

```{r hadley-filter-flights-between, exercise=TRUE}
filter(flights, )
```

```{r hadley-filter-flights-between-solution}
# since it is numeric, we can check via range boundaries
filter(flights, between(month, 7, 9) )
```


**Exercise:** Find all flights that are more than two hours late, but didn’t leave late.

```{r hadley-filter-flights-late, exercise=TRUE}
filter(flights, )
```

```{r hadley-filter-flights-late-solution}
filter(flights, arr_delay > 120 & dep_delay <= 0)
# Note, delays can be negative (early start).

# you can also encode "AND" compositions via multiple filter calls (comma separated)
filter(flights, arr_delay > 120, dep_delay <= 0)
```


**Exercise:** Find all flights that were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight.

```{r hadley-filter-flights-multilate, exercise=TRUE}
filter(flights, )
```

```{r hadley-filter-flights-multilate-solution}
filter(flights, dep_delay >= 60, dep_delay - arr_delay > 30)
# If the flight didn’t make up any time in the air, then its arrival would be delayed by the same amount as its departure, meaning dep_delay == arr_delay, or alternatively, dep_delay - arr_delay == 0. 
# If it makes up over 30 minutes in the air, then the arrival delay must be at least 30 minutes less than the departure delay, which is stated as dep_delay - arr_delay > 30.
```



### [5.2.3 Missing values](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#missing-values)

Identify all flights where the departing time `dep_time` is unknown (`NA`). How many are there?

```{r hadley-filter-flights-NA, exercise=TRUE}
filter(flights, )
```

```{r hadley-filter-flights-NA-solution}
filter(flights, is.na(dep_time))
# yields 8255 rows
```



The output of the function `summary()` includes the number of missing values for all non-character variables.

```{r flights-summary}
summary(flights)
```



## filter @ModernDive


The book *Statistical Inference via Data Science - A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse* by Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim also provides a similar but much shorter introduction to `filter()` in Chapter [3 Data Wrangling](https://moderndive.com/3-wrangling.html).

In contrast to R4DS, this introduction already focuses on the combination of different data transformation steps using the **pipe** operator `%>%`, which is directly introduced before detailing `filter()`.

We thus recommend the study of this (short) chapter, to

- learn about *piping* using `%>%`
- revisit `filter()` and respective notations
- double check your understanding

Again, the respective chapter to study is linked in the section header.


### Section [3.1 Piping](https://moderndive.com/3-wrangling.html#piping)


**A central concept** to do efficient data processing in general is to *decompose* the overall processing task *into* small, well-defined *steps* like filtering, sorting, grouping, etc.
The overall workflow is then the step-wise execution of these tasks.

For instance, to identify the mean value of the top-10 elements, we have to

1. sort the list
2. take the the top-10 elements
3. compute the mean

That is, each step operates on the result from the previous step and produces the starting point for the next.

The "pipe" concept (intruced in the [`magrittr` package](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/)) is a powerful tool to create readable and maintable data processing workflows as the one above.

To pick up the example from above, a respective workflow could look like this:

```{r r-example-code, eval=FALSE}
mydata %>%
  arrange(someVariable) %>%
  sclice_head(n=10) %>%
  summarize( avgValue = mean(somOtherVariable) )
```

**The idea** is simple: the output of one function (left of the `%>%` operator) becomes the first input argument of the next function (right of the `%>%` operator).

**Note:** there is no explicit (first) input value to all functions on the right side of `%>%`! This is automagically filled by the pipe operator with the result from the left side of the operator!

**Note further:** When distributing the workflow (multiple functions connected by pipes) over multiple lines, you have to ensure either the pipe operator is at the end of the line, or a bracket etc. is still open at line end.
Otherwise, R will not recognize that all lines form one workflow.

```{r broken pipe, eval=FALSE}
# the following is a "broken" pipe, where the lines are treated independently
mydata  # command ends here since no open bracket nor an "open operator" (will cause printing of mydata)
 %>% filter( mvar == 2 ) # will cause an error, since the left-side of the pipe is not defined
```


**Exercise:** Write the following code as a pipe using the `%>%` operator.

```{r piping-flights, exercise=TRUE}
filter(flights, carrier == "AS")
```

```{r piping-flights-solution}
flights %>%
  filter(carrier == "AS")
# or in one row
flights %>% filter(carrier == "AS")
```


### Section [3.2 `filter` rows](https://moderndive.com/3-wrangling.html#filter)

Note, the `View()` calls used within the ModernDive examples can be replaced via a `print()` in the interactive console of this tutorial.

```{r md-filter-pipe, exercise=TRUE}
portland_flights <- flights %>% 
  filter(dest == "PDX")
# viewing via print
print(portland_flights)
```


Stop reading in the book for now at the end of section 3.2!



## Wrap-up

But before we continue, think about the following questions, which can be answered with the current material.


```{r dplyr-table-arg-pos, echo=FALSE}
question("All dplyr functions take the input table as ..",
  answer(".. first argument", correct=TRUE),
  answer(".. last argument"),
  answer("Both is possible.")
)
```



```{r filter-cond-sep, echo=FALSE}
question("Multiple conditions that have to be fulfilled are separated by",
  answer("`;`"),
  answer("`,`", correct=TRUE),
  answer("`&`", correct=TRUE),
  answer("`|`"),
  answer("`>`"),
  answer("`%>%`")
)
```

- What is done by the `!` operator?
- What is missing in the following conditional statement? `1 %in% (1,2,3,4)`
- Do you remember how to use the `between()` function?
- Why do we need the `is.na()` function and cannot test via `myVariable == NA`?
- Any idea about piping and how to connect function calls?
