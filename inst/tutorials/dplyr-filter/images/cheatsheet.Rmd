## Cheatsheet "dplyr-filter"

- vector creation via `c()` (*concatenate*)
- conditional statements/functions
  - `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
  - `&`, `|`, `xor()`
  - `!`
  - `%in%` vector (or counterpart `%notin%`)
  - `between()` (dplyr)
  - `near()` better for floating point number comparison than `==`
- `filter()`
  - multiple sequential filter steps separated by comma or `&`
  - direct use of variable (column) names in filter criteria
  - brackets in conditional statements are often important!
- `%>%` piping for connection of data transformation steps
  - (first) input argument of subsequent function automatically set (with result of last)
- `summary()` statistical overview of values in data structure
