## Cheatsheet "ggplot-basics"

- `help()` provides details information on functions, data sets, packages
  -  `?` short version
- `head()` first elements of object
- `glimpse()` compact variable view of tabular data (from `dplyr` package)
- `ggplot2` is the visualization package
  - `ggplot()` defines what data to plot (and general/shared aesthetics)
  - `aes()` *aesthetics* define what data variables are used where in the plot, i.e. their *mapping*
  - `geom_...()` defines how to plot the data, i.e. the plot *geometry*, e.g.
    - `geom_point()`
    - `geom_line()`
    - `geom_smooth()`
  - `+` combines different geometries etc. into one plot
- R combines *multiple lines* into one call if at the end of a line
  - there is an operator like `+`, `<-`, `=`, ...
  - it misses still a closing bracket or brace, i.e. `)`, `]`, `}`, or closing quote, i.e. `"`, `'`
