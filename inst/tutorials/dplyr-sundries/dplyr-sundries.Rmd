## The `dplyr` package

![](images/dplyr-logo.png){width=10%}

The [`dplyr` package](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) provides the central functions for data transformation within the `tidyverse` universe.
Common tasks of data transformation are typically made of a serious of steps that can be implemented by the following *verbs* of dplyr: 

- *filter*, 
- *mutate*, 
- *arrange*, 
- *select* and 
- *summarize*.

But there are other useful verbs and aspects concerning data processing with `dplyr`, which are the topic of this tutorial.


## Rename columns

Sometimes the variable names of your table are long, ugly, complicated, misleading or all at once. 
Thus, you need to rename them, which can be done via the `rename()` function.
For instance, the following code will rename the first column to `Weight` and the variable `Chick` to `ChickenID`.

```{r rename-example}
# variable names of ChickWeight
colnames(ChickWeight)
# renaming
rename(ChickWeight, Weight = 1, ChickenID = Chick) %>% 
  # and rechecking the variable names
  colnames()
```

Note, we used the `colnames()` function to extract the names of the table's variables before and after the rename.

Further examples and details are provided on the [`rename()` reference website](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/rename.html).

To test it yourself look up the help page of the `starwars` data set and do the following

- rename the 2nd column in `height_in_cm`
- rename the `mass` variable to `weight_in_kg`
- reduce the data set to droids
- reduce the columns to the renamed ones
- compute mean values for both variables


```{r starwars-droid-stats, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r starwars-droid-stats-solution}
starwars %>% 
  rename( height_in_cm = 2,
          weight_in_kg = mass) %>% 
  filter( species == "Droid") %>% # needs the table's help page or checking of the data
  select( height_in_cm, weight_in_kg) %>% 
  summarize( mean_height_in_cm = mean(height_in_cm, na.rm=T), # remember the NA problem!
             mean_weight_in_kg = mean(weight_in_kg, na.rm=T))
```

Try to rename the `name` variable from the `starwars` data set to `42`. Think about and explain your observation.

```{r starwars-wrong-rename, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r starwars-wrong-rename-solution}
# this rename is not working
starwars %>% 
  rename( 42 = name)
# since "42" is no valid variable name (starts with a digit)

# Thus, R is surprised to see the assignment operator after the digit
# and provides a respective error message.
```



## Slice out rows

Another set of common tasks is to 

- *extract the best/worst observations* w.r.t. the values within a given variable column (`slice_min(), slice_max()`)
- *get first/last rows* w.r.t. the current row order (`slice_head(), slice_tail()`)
- *select only specific rows by index* (`slice()`) or
- *pick some rows at random* (`slice_sample()`) .

While most of these tasks could be solved with a combination of rank computation and filtering, it is more convenient to use the dedicated `slice()` function and its variants named after each task.

Each of the `slice` functions takes an `n=..` argument to name the number of rows to keep.

For instance, we can identify the five lightest humans in Star Wars via

```{r fat-starwars, exercise=TRUE}
starwars %>% 
  filter( species == "Human" ) %>% 
  slice_min( mass, n=5 ) %>% 
  select( name, mass )
```

Did you note that we get more than 5 rows? 
This is a result from ranking ties, i.e. multiple observations show the same weight and are thus not distinguishable.
If still interested in only 5 rows, we could either subsequently prune the list to the top 5 using `slice_head()` or set `with_ties = F` to disable the listing of all alternatives with the same value.

```{r fat-starwars-solution}
# further pruning via second slice
starwars %>% 
  filter( species == "Human" ) %>% 
  slice_min(mass, n=5) %>% 
  select( name, mass ) %>% 
  slice_head(n=5)

# or disable listing of all ties
starwars %>% 
  filter( species == "Human" ) %>% 
  slice_min(mass, n=5, with_ties = F ) %>% 
  select( name, mass )
```

A detailed summary and list of examples is available on the [`slice()` reference website](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/slice.html).


## Distinct rows

When reducing the number of variables it often happens that observations are getting undistinguishable, i.e. multiple rows are showing the same values.
Thus, one wants to *remove duplicated observations* to *keep only unique* ones.

This can be accomplished using the `distinct()` function.
When used without further arguments, it removes all duplicated rows from a table, keeping only the first occurrence.

Try in the following to identify the unique `gender` and `sex` combinations within the `starwars` data set

```{r distinct-table, exercise=TRUE}
starwars %>% 
  select( gender, sex ) %>% 
```
  
```{r distinct-table-solution}
starwars %>% 
  select( gender, sex ) %>% 
  distinct()
```

The same can be produced, when naming the variables of interest for which unique values/combinations are to be produced:

```{r unique-combis}
starwars %>% 
  distinct(gender, sex)
```

In that case, only the first row that shows a unique combination is kept.

Try in the following to produce the same set of observations (order doesn't matter) as from the `distinct(starwars, gender, sex)` call from above but using only the already known `dplyr` verbs *without* `distinct()`!


```{r distinct-fake, exercise=TRUE}
starwars %>% 
```
  
```{r distinct-fake-solution}
starwars %>% 
  # reducing the table to columns of interest
  select(sex,gender) %>% 
  # decompose into groups that are unique w.r.t. to both variables
  group_by( gender, sex ) %>% 
  # keep only first row of each group
  slice_head(n=1)
```


While useful, we are often interested in examples that are unique w.r.t. to a specific variable but we want to keep the whole information (and not reduce the output to a single variable).
This can be achieved using the `.keep_all=TRUE` argument of `distinct()`, which you can test below.


```{r unique-combis-keepAll, exercise=TRUE}
starwars %>% 
  distinct(gender, sex, .keep_all = TRUE )
```



A detailed summary and list of examples is available on the [`distinct()` reference website](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/distinct.html).
