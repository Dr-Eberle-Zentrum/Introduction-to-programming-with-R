## The `dplyr` package

![](images/dplyr-logo.png){width=10%}

The [`dplyr` package](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) provides the central functions for data transformation within the `tidyverse` universe.
Common tasks of data transformation are typically made of a serious of steps that can be implemented by the following *verbs* of dplyr: 

- *filter*, 
- *mutate*, 
- *arrange*, 
- *select* and 
- *summarize*.

But there are other useful verbs and aspects concerning data processing with `dplyr`, which are the topic of this tutorial.


## Rename columns

Sometimes the variable names of your table are long, ugly, complicated, misleading or all at once. 
Thus, you need to rename them, which can be done via the `rename()` function.
For instance, the following code will rename the first column to `Weight` and the variable `Chick` to `ChickenID`.

```{r rename-example}
# variable names of ChickWeight
colnames(ChickWeight)
# renaming
rename(ChickWeight, Weight = 1, ChickenID = Chick) %>% 
  # and rechecking the variable names
  colnames()
```

Note, we used the `colnames()` function to extract the names of the table's variables before and after the rename.

Further examples and details are provided on the 

- [`rename()` reference website](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/rename.html).

To test it yourself, look up the help page of the `starwars` data set and do the following

- rename the 2nd column in `height_in_cm`
- rename the `mass` variable to `weight_in_kg`
- reduce the data set to droids
- reduce the columns to the renamed ones
- compute mean values for both variables


```{r starwars-droid-stats, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r starwars-droid-stats-solution}
starwars %>% 
  rename( height_in_cm = 2,
          weight_in_kg = mass) %>% 
  filter( species == "Droid") %>% # needs the table's help page or checking of the data
  select( height_in_cm, weight_in_kg) %>% 
  summarize( mean_height_in_cm = mean(height_in_cm, na.rm=T), # remember the NA problem!
             mean_weight_in_kg = mean(weight_in_kg, na.rm=T))
```

Try to rename the `name` variable from the `starwars` data set to `42`. Think about and explain your observation.

```{r starwars-wrong-rename, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r starwars-wrong-rename-solution}
# this rename is not working
starwars %>% 
  rename( 42 = name)
# since "42" is no valid variable name (starts with a digit)

# Thus, R is surprised to see the assignment operator after the digit
# and provides a respective error message.
```



## Slice out rows

Another set of common tasks is to 

- *extract the best/worst observations* w.r.t. the values within a given variable column (`slice_min(), slice_max()`)
- *get first/last rows* w.r.t. the current row order (`slice_head(), slice_tail()`)
- *select only specific rows by index* (`slice()`) or
- *pick some rows at random* (`slice_sample()`) .

While most of these tasks could be solved with a combination of rank computation and filtering, it is more convenient to use the dedicated `slice()` function and its variants named after each task.

Each of the `slice` functions takes an `n=..` argument to name the number of rows to keep.

For instance, we can identify the five lightest humans in Star Wars via

```{r fat-starwars, exercise=TRUE}
starwars %>% 
  filter( species == "Human" ) %>% 
  slice_min( mass, n=5 ) %>% 
  select( name, mass )
```

Did you note that we get more than 5 rows? 
This is a result from ranking ties, i.e. multiple observations show the same weight and are thus not distinguishable.
If still interested in only 5 rows, we could either subsequently prune the list to the top 5 using `slice_head()` or set `with_ties = F` to disable the listing of all alternatives with the same value.

```{r fat-starwars-solution}
# further pruning via second slice
starwars %>% 
  filter( species == "Human" ) %>% 
  slice_min(mass, n=5) %>% 
  select( name, mass ) %>% 
  slice_head(n=5)

# or disable listing of all ties
starwars %>% 
  filter( species == "Human" ) %>% 
  slice_min(mass, n=5, with_ties = F ) %>% 
  select( name, mass )
```

Using `prop=..`, we can also carve out a respective fraction of the observations.

A detailed summary and list of examples is available on the 

- [`slice()` reference website](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/slice.html).


## Distinct rows

When reducing the number of variables it often happens that observations are getting undistinguishable, i.e. multiple rows are showing the same values.
Thus, one wants to *remove duplicated observations* to *keep only unique* ones.

This can be accomplished using the `distinct()` function.
When used without further arguments, it removes all duplicated rows from a table, keeping only the first occurrence.

Try in the following to identify the unique `gender` and `sex` combinations within the `starwars` data set

```{r distinct-table, exercise=TRUE}
starwars %>% 
  select( gender, sex ) %>% 
```
  
```{r distinct-table-solution}
starwars %>% 
  select( gender, sex ) %>% 
  distinct()
```

The same can be produced, when naming the variables of interest for which unique values/combinations are to be produced:

```{r unique-combis}
starwars %>% 
  distinct(gender, sex)
```

In that case, only the first row that shows a unique combination is kept.

Try in the following to produce the same set of observations (order doesn't matter) as from the `distinct(starwars, gender, sex)` call from above but using only the already known `dplyr` verbs *without* `distinct()`!


```{r distinct-fake, exercise=TRUE}
starwars %>% 
```
  
```{r distinct-fake-solution}
starwars %>% 
  # reducing the table to columns of interest
  select(sex,gender) %>% 
  # decompose into groups that are unique w.r.t. to both variables
  group_by( gender, sex ) %>% 
  # keep only first row of each group
  slice_head(n=1)
```


While useful, we are often interested in examples that are unique w.r.t. to a specific variable but we want to keep the whole information (and not reduce the output to a single variable).
This can be achieved using the `.keep_all=TRUE` argument of `distinct()`, which you can test below.


```{r unique-combis-keepAll, exercise=TRUE}
starwars %>% 
  distinct(gender, sex, .keep_all = TRUE )
```



A detailed summary and list of examples is available on the 

- [`distinct()` reference website](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/distinct.html).


## Joining tables

Often data is distributed over different tables.
As an example, think about a table that provides data for each town in Germany including the respective state.
A second table gathers details about the states.
In order to draw conclusions or visualize relations of town and state data, we first have to *join* the two data sets.
That is, we want to create a new *tidy* table that extends the town information with the respective full state information.
Such an operation is called a *left join*.
There are other possible table joins that are briefly introduced in the following video.

![](https://youtu.be/Yg-pNqzDuN4){width="60%"}

The video's examples (using tibbles instead of data.frames) can be tested in the following interactive exercise.

```{r videoexample, exercise=TRUE}
data1 <- tibble(ID = 1:2, X1 = c("a1","a2"))
data2 <- tibble(ID = 2:3, X2 = c("b1","b2"))

inner_join( data1, data2, by = "ID")
left_join( data1, data2, by = "ID")
right_join( data1, data2, by = "ID")
full_join( data1, data2, by = "ID")
semi_join( data1, data2, by = "ID")
anti_join( data1, data2, by = "ID")
```

While this defines the easiest way to do, one often faces the problem that the tables do not feature the same name for the columns one wants to join the tables on.
Thus, one either has to 

- either rename the column in one of the tables
- or use specify both column names in a "rename-like" notion `by = c(VAR1 = VAR2)` where `VAR1` and `VAR2` are the two column names.

Test both ways for a left join of the following two data sets. Consider a pipe for the first variant!

```{r videoexample-rename, exercise=TRUE}
data1 <- tibble(ID = 1:2, X1 = c("a1","a2"))
data2 <- tibble(id = 2:3, X2 = c("b1","b2"))
```

```{r videoexample-rename-solution}
# using a column rename for the first table
data1 %>%
  rename(id = ID) %>%
  left_join( data2, by = "id")

# specifying both column names in join
left_join( data1, data2, by = c("ID" = "id"))
```

This type of data operation is closely related to data organization and manipulation in relational databases using SQL, which is also detailed in the *join* tutorial of ModernDive.
The examples from the following chapter and sections are provided below.

- [3.7 `join` data frames](https://moderndive.com/3-wrangling.html#joins)

Note, the required data package `nycflights13` is already preloaded within this tutorial.

```{r airlinesview, exercise=TRUE}
# use "head()" here rather than "View()" since we are not in RStudio
head(airlines)
```

Joining the flights with airline information.

```{r join-flight-airline, exercise=TRUE}
# let's use only the first ten flights for now and reduce the variables
first_flights <- 
  flights %>% 
  slice_head(n=10)
# joining
flights_joined <- 
  first_flights %>% 
  inner_join(airlines, by = "carrier")
# printing
print(first_flights)
print(flights_joined)
```

To better see the effect, reduce the `first_flights` table to the variables `tailnum` and `carrier`.

```{r join-flight-airline-solution}
# let's use only the first ten flights for now and reduce the variables
first_flights <- 
  flights %>% 
  select(tailnum, carrier) %>% 
  slice_head(n=10)
# joining
flights_joined <- 
  first_flights %>% 
  inner_join(airlines, by = "carrier")
# printing
print(first_flights)
print(flights_joined)
```

Now let's check the `airports`.

```{r view-airports, exercise=TRUE}
head(airports)
```

And do a left join (with a reduced `flights` table).

```{r join-airport-name, exercise=TRUE}
flights %>% 
  slice_head(n=10) %>% 
  select( tailnum, dest) %>% 
  inner_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))
```

And the summarizing example

```{r join-summary, exercise=TRUE}
flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(num_flights = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_flights)) %>%
  inner_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>%
  rename(airport_name = name)
```

As well as the "multi-key" example

```{r multi-key, exercise=TRUE}
flights %>%
  slice_head(n=10) %>% 
  select(tailnum, year,month,day,hour,origin) %>% 
  inner_join(weather, by = c("year", "month", "day", "hour", "origin"))
```

## Wrap-up

But before we continue, think about the following questions, which can be answered with the current material.

- Do you still remember the constraints on variable names in R?
- Can you define a variable name with spaces? Did you try?
- When do you need to quote variable names in dplyr operations?
- What does `slice( SOMEDATA, n=n())` do?
- We want the first half of observations and try `slice_head( SOMEDATA, n=n()/2)`. How to fix it?
- What verb was used to remove duplicates?
- What happens when a left join is done but no values in the respective key columns match?
