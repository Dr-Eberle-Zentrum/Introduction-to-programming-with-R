## The `stringr` package

![](images/stringr-logo.png){width=10%}

The [`stringr` package](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) provides the central functions for string processing within the `tidyverse` universe.
It is a compilation functions to tackle of standard tasks concerning strings like:

- Compose strings from other strings.
- Determine which strings match a pattern.
- Find the positions of matches.
- Extract the content of matches.
- Replace matches with new values.
- Split a string based on a match.

The functions from the `stringr` package are simplified variants from the more powerful (but complex) [`stringi` package](https://stringi.gagolewski.com/).
Thus, if you find `stringr` not sufficient, check the `stringi` package.

Within this tutorial, we first focus on the basics of string process, i.e. details of *string encoding* and *regular expressions*, the workhorses of pattern matching.


To this end, you will study the first parts of the [Strings](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html) chapter of the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) online tutorial of the book by Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund.

Since the online book tutorial is not interactive, you are encouraged to use the following interactive R consoles to

- repeat and follow the code examples of the tutorial
- solve the exercises of the tutorial (which we recreated below)

So let's start! 

In the following, we link (via the section headlines) the specific chapters to be studied.
For each chapter, you find within each tutorial section respective interactive consoles and additional information.

## String basics

### [Study 14 - 14.2 String basics @ R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html)

Note, the `tidyverse` package is already loaded and ready within this tutorial.

Printing of special characters (escaping).
```{r stringr-print, exercise=TRUE}
x <- c("\"", "\\", "\u00b5")
x
writeLines(x)
```

#### 14.2.2 Combining strings

Concatenation of strings.
```{r stringr-c-sep, exercise=TRUE}
str_c("x", "y", sep = ", ")
```

`NA` handling.
```{r stringr-c-NA, exercise=TRUE}
x <- c("abc", NA)
str_c("|-", x, "-|")
str_c("|-", str_replace_na(x), "-|")
```

Concatenation vs. collapse.
Why do both calls provide the same result?
What are the differences and respective effects?
```{r concat-vs-collapse, exercise=TRUE}
str_c("x", "y", "z", sep = ", ")
str_c(c("x", "y", "z"), collapse = ", ")
```

```{r concat-vs-collapse-solution}
str_c("x", "y", "z", sep = ", ")
# here we are CONCATENATING three vectors (of length one)
# where resp. vector elements are SEPARATED by ", "

str_c(c("x", "y", "z"), collapse = ", ")
# here we are COLLAPSING the values of ONE vector
# (eventually, FIRST we concatenate the vector with nothing 
# and the RESULTing vector is than collapsed...)
```


#### 14.2.3 Subsetting strings

```{r substr-examples, exercise=TRUE}
x <- c("Apple", "Banana", "Pear")
# substring
str_sub(x, 1, 3)
# negative numbers count backwards from end
str_sub(x, -3, -1)
# out of range
str_sub(x, 5, 10)
```

#### 14.2.4 Locales

Lexicographic sorting as well as capitalization is language specific.
Thus, set the specific `locale` when working with non-english text.
Language codes can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

```{r local-examples, exercise=TRUE}
# Turkish has two i's: with and without a dot, and it
# has a different rule for capitalizing them:
str_to_upper(c("i", "ı"))
str_to_upper(c("i", "ı"), locale = "tr")
```


#### 14.2.5 Exercises



1. In code that doesn’t use `stringr`, you’ll often see `paste()` and `paste0()`. What’s the difference between the two functions? What `stringr` function are they equivalent to? How do the functions differ in their handling of `NA`?


```{r ex-1, exercise=TRUE}
paste("a","b","c",NA)
paste0("a","b","c",NA)
str_c("a","b","c",NA)
```
```{r ex-1-solution}
# The function paste() separates strings by spaces by default, 
# while paste0() does not separate strings with spaces by default.
# Since str_c() does not separate strings with spaces by default 
# it is closer in behavior to paste0().

# However, str_c() and the paste function handle NA differently. 
# The function str_c() propagates NA, if any argument is a missing value, 
# it returns a missing value. 
# This is in line with how the numeric R functions, e.g. sum(), mean(), handle missing values.
# However, the paste functions, convert NA to the string "NA" 
# and then treat it as any other character vector.
```


2. In your own words, describe the difference between the `sep` and `collapse` arguments to `str_c()`.


```{r ex-2, exercise=TRUE}
str_c("Hallo", c("Anna","Herbert"), sep=" ", collapse=". ")
```
```{r ex-2-solution}
# The sep argument is the string inserted between arguments to str_c(), 
# while collapse is the string used to separate any elements of the 
# final character vector into a character vector of length one.
```

3. Use `str_length()` and `str_sub()` to extract the middle character from a string. What will you do if the string has an even number of characters?

```{r ex-3, exercise=TRUE}
word1 = "Hallo"
word2 = "Anna"
```
```{r ex-3-solution}
# bracketing triggers printing for checking the value
# need "+1" for word of odd length
(mid1 = str_length(word1)/2+1)
str_sub( word1, mid1, mid1 )
# "+1" yields the "post-middle" letter of words of even length
(mid2 = str_length(word2)/2+1)
str_sub( word2, mid2, mid2 )
```

3.1 Can you write a vectorized version of the last exercise using a piping?
Note: with `.` you can refer to the piped input of the current command!
That is `.` us a placeholder for the data that was transferred via `%>%` from the last command to the current one.

```{r ex-3_1, exercise=TRUE}
c("Hallo", "Anna")
```
```{r ex-3_1-solution}
c("Hallo", "Anna") %>% 
  str_sub( str_length(.)/2+1, str_length(.)/2+1)
```


4. What does `str_wrap()` do? When might you want to use it?

```{r ex-4, exercise=TRUE}
rep("Na sowas!", 20) %>% 
  str_c( collapse=" ") %>% 
  # uncomment to check the effect
  # str_wrap(width = 20) %>% 
  writeLines()
```
```{r ex-4-solution}
# The function str_wrap() wraps text so that it fits within a certain width. 
# This is useful for wrapping long strings of text to be typeset.
```


5. What does `str_trim()` do? What’s the opposite of `str_trim()`?

```{r ex-5, exercise=TRUE}
str_trim(" abc ")
str_trim(" abc ", side = "left")
str_trim(" abc ", side = "right")
```
```{r ex-5-solution}
# The function str_trim() trims the whitespace from a string.

# The opposite of str_trim() is str_pad() which adds characters to each side.
str_pad("abc", 5, side = "both")
str_pad("abc", 4, side = "right")
str_pad("abc", 4, side = "left")
```


Exercise 6 is too complex for now (when you only followed the tutorial so far), 
but you can checkout a [solution online](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/strings.html#exercise-14.2.6).



## Regular expressions

### [Study 14.3 Matching patterns with regular expressions @ R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html#matching-patterns-with-regular-expressions)

####  14.3.1 Basic matches 

```{r regex-simple-example, exercise=TRUE}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, ".a.")
```

Exercises

1. Explain why each of the following regular expression encodings (`"\"`, `"\\"`, `"\\\"`) don’t match the single character (string) `\`!

```{r ex-basic-1, exercise=TRUE}
# AFTER thinking about the question, you can check out the solution... ;)
```
```{r ex-basic-1-solution}
# "\"   : This will escape the next character in the R string.
# "\\"  : This will resolve to \ in the regular expression, 
#         which will escape the next character in the regular expression.
# "\\\" : The first two backslashes will resolve to a literal backslash 
#         in the regular expression, the third will escape the next character. 
#         So in the regular expression, this will escape some escaped character.
```

2. How would you match the string/sequence `"'\` ?

```{r ex-basic-2, exercise=TRUE}
# extend the following call with the string to check and the pattern
str_view( string = "", pattern = "")
```
```{r ex-basic-2-hint-1}
# string encoding will need some escaping
```
```{r ex-basic-2-hint-2}
# string encoding will need some escaping
str_view( string = "\"'\\", pattern = "")
```
```{r ex-basic-2-hint-3}
# regex pattern need double escaping of the backslash letter
str_view( string = "\"'\\", pattern = "\"'\\\\")
```

3. What patterns will the regular expression `\..\..\..` match? 
How would you represent it as a string?

```{r ex-basic-3, exercise=TRUE}
# Think about some example strings first, that could be matched by the regex
str_view( string = c("","",""), pattern = "")
```
```{r ex-basic-3-hint-1}
# One example might be this
str_view( string = c(".a.b.c","",""), pattern = "")
```
```{r ex-basic-3-hint-2}
# or parts of these
str_view( string = c(".a.b.c", "1.2.3.4", "....."), pattern = "")
```
```{r ex-basic-3-hint-3}
# and now with regex
str_view( string = c(".a.b.c", "1.2.3.4", "......."), pattern = "\\..\\..\\..")
```
```{r ex-basic-3-hint-4}
# are the shown matches the only possible ones?
```


#### 14.3.2 Anchors


```{r regex-anchor-example, exercise=TRUE}
x <- c("apple pie", "apple", "apple cake")
# try them without anchors!
str_view(x, "^a")
str_view(x, "le$")
str_view(x, "\\bp")
# this is quite constraint
str_view(x, "^apple$")
```

Exercises



1. How would you match the literal string `"$^$"`?


```{r ex-regex-ex-1, exercise=TRUE}
str_view(c("$^$","don't-$^$-match"), "")
```
```{r ex-regex-ex-1-solution}
str_view(c("$^$","don't-$^$-match"), "^\\$\\^\\$$")
```


2. Given the corpus of common (english) words in the data set `stringr::words`, create regular expressions that find all words as given below.
Since this list is long, you might want to use the `match` argument to `str_view()` to show only the matching or non-matching words.


```{r ex-regex-ex-2, exercise=TRUE}
# Start with `“y”`.
str_view( words, "" )
# End with `“x”`
str_view( words, "" )
# Are exactly three letters long.
str_view( words, "" )
# Have seven letters or more.
str_view( words, "" )
```
```{r ex-regex-ex-2-hint-1}
# Start with `“y”`.
str_view(stringr::words, "^y", match = TRUE)
```
```{r ex-regex-ex-2-hint-2}
# End with `“x”`
str_view(stringr::words, "x$", match = TRUE)
```
```{r ex-regex-ex-2-hint-3}
# Are exactly three letters long.
# due to both end anchors, only length-three words are matched
str_view(stringr::words, "^...$", match = TRUE)
```
```{r ex-regex-ex-2-hint-4}
# Have seven letters or more.
# without end anchors, also longer words are matched
str_view(stringr::words, ".......", match = TRUE)
```


#### 14.3.3 Character classes and alternatives

```{r example-classes, exercise=TRUE}
# Look for a literal character that normally has special meaning in a regex
str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "a*c", "a c"), "a[.]c")
# alternatives and grouping
str_view(c("grey", "gray"), "gr(e|a)y")
```

Exercises



1.  Create regular expressions to find all words that:

```{r ex-class-ex-1, exercise=TRUE}
# Start with a vowel.
str_view( words, "")
# That only contain consonants. (Hint: thinking about matching “not”-vowels.)
str_view( words, "")
# End with "ed", but not with "eed".
str_view( words, "")
# End with "ing" or "ise".
str_view( words, "")
```
```{r ex-class-ex-1-hint-1}
# Start with a vowel.
str_view( words, "^[aeiou]", match=TRUE)
```
```{r ex-class-ex-1-hint-2}
# That only contain consonants. (Hint: thinking about matching “not”-vowels.)
str_view( words, "[aeiou]", match=FALSE)
```
```{r ex-class-ex-1-hint-3}
# End with "ed", but not with "eed".
str_view( words, "[^e]ed$", match=TRUE)
```
```{r ex-class-ex-1-hint-4}
# End with "ing" or "ise".
str_view( words, "i(ng|se)$", match=TRUE)
```


2.  Empirically verify the [spelling rule `“i before e except after c”`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_before_E_except_after_C) for words of the English language.
To this end, count the number of matches following or violating the rule.


```{r ex-class-ex-2, exercise=TRUE}
# check occurrences in accordance with the rule (using a resp. regex)
length(str_subset( words, "" ))
# check violations by encoding the contrary regex
length(str_subset( words, "" ))
```
```{r ex-class-ex-2-solution}
# check occurrences in accordance with the rule (using a resp. regex)
length(str_subset( words, "(cei|[^c]ie)" ))
# check violations by encoding the contrary regex
length(str_subset( words, "(cie|[^c]ei)" ))
```

3.  Is `“q”` always followed by a `“u”`?

```{r ex-class-ex-3, exercise=TRUE}
str_view( words, "")
```
```{r ex-class-ex-3-solution}
# eventually yes: the output of the following is empty
str_view( words, "q[^u]", match=TRUE)
# most common words follow the rules. 
# there are only very few and rare counter-example.
```

4.  Write a regular expression that matches a word if it’s probably written in British English, not American English.

A solution to this exercise is [discussed online](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/strings.html#exercise-14.3.3.4).

5.  Create a regular expression that will match telephone numbers as commonly written in your country.

Eventually, a good answer to this exercise requires repetition encodings only discussed in the next section. Thus, if interested, refer to an [online solution discussion](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/strings.html#exercise-14.3.3.5).


#### 14.3.4 Repetition


```{r example-repeat, exercise=TRUE}
x <- "1888 is the longest year in Roman numerals: MDCCCLXXXVIII"
str_view(x, "CC?")
str_view(x, "CC+")
str_view(x, 'C[LX]+')
str_view(x, "C{2}")
str_view(x, "C{2,}")
str_view(x, "C{2,3}")
```

Exercises

1. Describe the equivalents of `?`, `+`, `*` in `{m,n}` form.

```{r ex-rep-ex-1, exercise=TRUE}
# rewrite with {m,n} notation
str_view( "aaa", "a?")
str_view( "aaa", "a+")
str_view( "aaa", "a*")
```
```{r ex-rep-ex-1-solution}
# ?
str_view( "aaa", "a{0,1}")
# +
str_view( "aaa", "a{1,}")
# *
str_view( "aaa", "a{0,}")
```


2. Describe in words what these regular expressions match: 
(read carefully to see if I’m using a regular expression or a string that defines a regular expression.)


```{r ex-rep-ex-2, exercise=TRUE}
#1   ^.*$
#2   "\\{.+\\}"
#3   \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}
#4   "\\\\{4}"
```
```{r ex-rep-ex-2-hint-1}
#1 ^.*$ will match any string. For example: 
str_view(c("dog", "$1.23", "lorem ipsum"), "^.*$")
```
```{r ex-rep-ex-2-hint-2}
#2 "\\{.+\\}" will match any string with curly braces surrounding 
# at least one character. For example: 
str_view( c("{a}", "{abc}"), "\\{.+\\}")
```
```{r ex-rep-ex-2-hint-3}
#3 \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} will match four digits followed by a hyphen, 
# followed by two digits followed by a hyphen, followed by another two digits. 
# This is a regular expression that can match dates formatted 
# like “YYYY-MM-DD” (“%Y-%m-%d”). For example: 
str_view("2018-01-11","\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}")
```
```{r ex-rep-ex-2-hint-4}
#4 "\\\\{4}" is \\{4}, which will match four backslashes. 
# For example: 
str_view("\\\\\\\\","\\\\{4}")
```


3. Create regular expressions to find all words that:

```{r ex-rep-ex-3, exercise=TRUE}
#  Start with three consonants.
str_view(words, "", match=TRUE)
#  Have three or more vowels in a row.
str_view(words, "", match=TRUE)
#  Have two or more vowel-consonant pairs in a row.
str_view(words, "", match=TRUE)
```
```{r ex-rep-ex-3-hint-1}
#  Start with three consonants.
str_view(words, "^[^aeiou]{3}", match=TRUE)
```
```{r ex-rep-ex-3-hint-2}
#  Have three or more vowels in a row.
str_view(words, "[aeiou]{3,}", match=TRUE)
```
```{r ex-rep-ex-3-hint-3}
#  Have two or more vowel-consonant pairs in a row.
str_view(words, "([aeiou][^aeiou]){2,}", match=TRUE)
```

4. Solve the tutorial regexp crosswords at [https://regexcrossword.com/challenges/tutorial](https://regexcrossword.com/challenges/tutorial).


This tutorial ends at the end of chapter 14.3 of R4DS.
So if you hit the section *14.4 Tools* you might want to take a break! ;)


## Raw character constants

When providing storing a string in a variable like `myDat <- "A\nB", the given sequence of characters is processed by R to generate the final list of characters stored within the variable.
In detail, each occurrence of a `\` triggers the investigation of the subsequent letters.
In our example, we find `\n`, which is the encoding for "line break".
That is, eventually, we will store the character sequence "A", "line break", "B", i.e. three characters instead of the initial four!

This "interpretation" of input strings from the source code complicates the encoding of regular expressions, since therein we want to  encode e.g. character classes like `\d`. 
In order to bypass the normal string interpretation, we have to "escape" the `\` of the `\d` with another `\`, which brings us to the final encoding `"\\d"`.

An alternative is to *disable string interpretation* using so call *raw character* constants.
Here, the string is embedded into `r"()"` instead of simply `"".
For instance for the regex above, we can write `r"(\d)"` and do not have to escape all character classes etc. within our regular expression.

In detail, we can also use `[]` or `{}` instead of `()` or single ticks `'` instead of double ticks `"`.
It is important that the encoded raw string does not contain the closing bracket-tick combination, thus the variability.
For more details check the respective paragraph in the `?Quotes` help page.


## Wrap-up

But before we continue, think about the following questions, which can be answered with the current material.

- How to incorporate "non-keyboard" letters into strings, e.g. for axis labels in plots?
- Can you generate the `"1."`, `"2."`, ... etc. starting from the integer vector `1:9`?
- How to get the length (number of characters) of a text string?
- Why and where do we need `locale` specification when dealing with strings?
- Can you name an example for each of the following regex elements, i.e. character class, anchor, repetition?
- What is meant when saying that pattern matching is "greedy"?
- Did you solve all regex crossword puzzles? :D
