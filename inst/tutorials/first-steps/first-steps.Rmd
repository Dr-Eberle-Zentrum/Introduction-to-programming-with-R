## Table data everywhere

Before we start to have a closer look how to do data processing with R, we first have to understand how data is (typically) formatted and how we can represent our data for subsequent processing.

In most cases, and thus all over this course, data comes in **table format**. 
An example of a tabular data set is given below.

![](images/data.frame.example.png){width=20%}

It is important to know the R requires data to be organized such that

- **each row** represents a **single observation**, i.e. **one "data unit"** (here a description of a single character) and
- **each column** describes a single feature/characteristic/attribute/measurement/**variable** of each observation.

Thus, it follows:

- all columns have the **same length** (one entry per observation = row)
- all columns represent the same **type** of data (e.g. the "size" column from above contains only numbers)
- different columns can represent different type of data (e.g. "name" vs. "size")

Before we can start with any data processing, we therefore have to ensure that the data is formatted correctly.


## Data processing workflow


A typical data processing workflow, which we will learn within this course, is therefore composed of the following steps:

1. loading data (e.g from file or creating it via some computation)
2. reformatting data (into a correct format, see above)
3. processing the data (using magic verbs like 'filter', 'mutate', 'arrange', ...)
4. storing data to file (or visualize it as an image).

This is exemplified in the following.
You don't have to understand the details right now, just see the general structure and major workflow steps.

```{r}
# load needed packages
library(tidyverse)

# (1) create data table
rawData <- data.frame(
            name = c("Mickey", "Fritz", "Ashley", "Clark", "Faust"),
            size = c( 56, 182, 167, 192, 173),
            real = c( T, F, F, T, T )
          )
# let's print it for inspection
print(rawData)

# (2) no reformatting needed, already in correct table format

# (3) add another "character" colum based on "real"
# and store in a new variable
myData <- mutate( rawData, character = ifelse(real, "real", "fictional") )

# (4) plot the final data
# create a blank canvas and tell ggplot what column to use where
ggplot( myData, aes(x = name, y = size, col = character ) ) + # '+' adds the next plot element
  
  # define what type of plot to draw using the data
  geom_point( size=4 ) # with additional plotting settings

```




## Print

You can print (e.g. to PDF file) your current processing state of this tutorial, i.e. all the already visited topics, using the button from below.

```{r print2pdf2, echo=FALSE}
# button can be placed anywhere in the tutorial
actionButton("print2pdf", "Print processed tutorial parts", style="opacity: .7; color: #000;")
```

To this end, you have to open the tutorial within a standard web browser like Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Edge, ... When you are running the tutorial within RStudio, you can use the `Open in Browser` button in the upper left corner of the window that shows the tutorial.
